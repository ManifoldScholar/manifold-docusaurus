Hello, and welcome to our Manifold Walkthroughs! This section of the documentation is different from our main documentation in a number of ways:

1. It is more conversational.
2. It is less technical.
3. It is focused on detailing how to *actually do* specific tasks in Manifold instead of chronicling the nature of each button and knob you may come across when working in Manifold. ðŸ¥³
4. It is incomplete.

That last point may seem troubling, but this section is incomplete by design, in the same way a garden is. We are going to continue to add and update this space as a practice, based on own work with Manifold as well as our experience working with other Manifold publishers.

And if youâ€™re wondering who _we_ are, wonder no more: we are Terence Smyre and Robin Miller of the Minnesota and CUNY branches of the Manifold family, respectively.

If there is something you donâ€™t see here but need but want or if there is something youâ€™d like us to expound further upon, just let us know at [contact@manifoldapp.org](mailto:contact@manifoldapp.org?subject=Walkthrough%20Suggestions&body=Dear%20Robin%20and%20Terence%2C%20I%20was%20just%20reading%20the%20Manifold%20Walkthroughs%2C%20and%20I%20was%20wondering%20.%20.%20.).
