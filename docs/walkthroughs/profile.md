When you first create an account on a Manifold instance, you are prompted for some basic information about yourself that helps make up your profile. This page describes how to edit and add to that information.

## Prerequisites

To update your profile you must already be logged into an instance of Manifold with an existing Manifold account.

## Directions

Select the user link button, displayed as a silhouette avatar, on the right side of the header. From the dropdown panel select **Edit Profile**.

This will open a modal overlay where you can use the provided text boxes to edit your **Nickname**, add a **Profile Image** from your device, or adjust your **First** and **Last Names**, **Email Address**, or your **Password**.

All changes made will take effect immediately after they are saved.
