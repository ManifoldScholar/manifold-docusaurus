This page details the process of logging into an instance of Manifold with an *existing* Manifold account. If you don’t already have an account, check out [the previous section](./walkthroughs/create_account.md) for notes on how to create one.

:::important
Manifold is “distributed” software. This means that Manifold accounts are not global. If you intend to engage with different Manifold installations, you’ll first need to establish yourself on each instance, even if you’re logging in with a social media profile.

## Directions

Select the user link button, displayed as a silhouette avatar, on the right side of the header. This will open a modal overlay where you can login with your existing account credentials.

If your account is associated with your email address, enter your email and password in the respective fields and select the **Log In** button.

Or select the **Log In** button identified with the social media service with which you established your Manifold account. That will open a pop-up window where you can input your Facebook, Google, or Twitter username and password.

After you’ve entered your credentials you will be logged in and redirected to the instance’s landing page.

## Account Benefits

By default, Manifold projects are open access, and thus anyone coming to an instance will be able to read them, even if they don’t have an account on the instance. However, if you want to engage with project content and other users, using highlights, annotations, or reading groups, you will need to be logged in with a Manifold account.

## Logging Out

To log out of Manifold, select the user avatar link in the header. From the dropdown panel choose the last item, the **Logout** button, and you will be logged out of the instance.
