Manifold Resources are media added to and contained within a Project. Resources may center an argument or contextualize and enhance a Text. This page details the latter, describing the process of associating Resources with specific passages of Texts. 

## Prerequisites

There are two requirements before a passage of Text can be annotated with a Resource: first, the Project must [contain at least one Resource](../backend/resource.md#adding-new-resources); second, a user must have the appropriate credentials to perform this action. Only those users who can access the Project in the backend or who are designated as [Project Authors](../backend/projects.md#editor-permissions) are able to place Resources onto a Project Text.

## Directions

While loading Resources to a Project takes place in the backend, placing an existing Project Resource in a Text happens in the frontend, in the Manifold Reader.

To place a Resource, open the Text you want to annotate and select with your mouse a specific passage of Text you want to associate the Resource with.

A menu will appear beside your pointer with a number of options. Select **Resource**. A drawer will open from the right of the screen with a view of all the Resources and Resource Collections currently loaded to the Project. From this view you can search for specific Resources or page through them.

Once you select a Resource (or Resource Collection) a marker in the form of a gray cube will appear at the end of your text selection and a thumbnail view of the Resource will appear in the left margin beside the text block. The Resource is now placed.

:::note
If you do not see **Resource** as an option when you select a passage of text, the account you’re logged in with doesn’t have the appropriate credentials to place a Resource.

## Removing Resources

If you want to remove a placed Resource, move your mouse over the thumbnail in the left margin. In the upper right corner of the thumbnail there is button, designated with an `X`, that will delete the notation when selected.

If using a keyboard, you can tab-select the Resource thumbnail and choose the delete button with the space bar.
