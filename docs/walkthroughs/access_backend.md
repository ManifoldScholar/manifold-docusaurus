The Manifold backend is where new projects are created, texts and resources are loaded, and where system settings are configured.

## Requirements

To access the Manifold backend, you will need a Manifold [user account](../docs/backend/users.md) with **Administrator**, **Editor**, **Marketeer**, or **Project Creator** credentials.

You can also access the backend if you have a **Reader** account that has been scoped Editor permissions to at least one Project. Read more about scoped permissions in the [Project Access](../docs/backend/projects.md#access) section.

## Directions

After youâ€™ve [logged into](../docs/walkthroughs/login.md) the Manifold instance, a new user link labelled **Enter Admin Mode** (or **Enter Editor Mode**, for those with privileged **Reader** accounts) will appear in the header, atop the page, beside the the search button spyglass. Select this link and you will enter the backend, with a view of the Dashboard.

## Exiting

To leave the backend and return to the public-facing side of Manifold, select the user link reading **Exit Admin Mode** from the backend header; it will be the second-to-last link in the header.
