Manifold was created to fulfill specific functions for academic readers. This section of the documentation explains the [reading interface](/docs/reading/interface) options and available activities like [annotation](/docs/reading/annotating), [sharing passages](/docs/reading/sharing) through social media, and creating [citations](/docs/reading/sharing.html#cite) to properly reference Manifold materials in your own work. The placing of [resources](/docs/reading/placing) and ways readers can organize their Manifold [project libraries](/docs/reading/library) are also considered here and are oriented thusly:

- [Project Library](/docs/reading/library)
- [Exploring Projects](/docs/reading/projects)
- [Reading Interface](/docs/reading/interface)
- [Sharing](/docs/reading/sharing)
- [Exploring and Placing Resources](/docs/reading/placing)
- [Annotating and Commenting](/docs/reading/annotating)
- [Highlighting](/docs/reading/highlighting)
- [Email Notifications](/docs/reading/notifications)

To begin taking advantage of all the tools described in this section you must first create an account and sign in from the homepage.
