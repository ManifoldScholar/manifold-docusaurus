Once you have installed Manifold, you may want to adjust your instance to represent your organization more specifically. From the backend, you can use the `Records` and `Settings` menus to access various options for customizing the appearance of and adding information to your instance:

## [Records](/docs/customizing/records/index)

* [Makers](/docs/projects/accounts/makers). Used to create records of those who have created or authored project materials. See the [Accounts and Roles](/docs/projects/accounts/index) section for more details.
* [Users](/docs/projects/accounts/users). Used to create accounts for those who will read and actively engage with materials on Manifold. See the [Accounts and Roles](/docs/projects/accounts/index) section for more details.
* [Pages](/docs/customizing/records/pages). Used for creating content pages (e.g., About, Privacy Policy).
* [Features](/docs/customizing/records/features). Where the featured content banner at the head of the homepage can be adjusted.

## [Settings](/docs/customizing/settings/index)
