## Signing Up

Creating an account is done by clicking the user icon in the top right corner of the screen and selecting the *"Need to sign up?"* link, and you can then enter your name, email, and a password. Alternatively, you can create an account using your existing Facebook, Twitter, or Google credentials if the instance has enabled those connections.

## Signing In

You sign in to a Manifold instance by clicking on the user icon in the top right corner of the screen. The system will prompt you for your account’s email and password. Once you are signed in, user profile settings, such as nickname, user profile image, first name, last name, email, and password, can be accessed and changed from by clicking user icon in the top right corner and selecting "Edit Profile" from the dropdown menu. From this screen you can also modify your notification settings.

## Notification Preferences

Using the Notifications settings, Manifold readers can have the system send either a daily or weekly email that summarizes any new Texts, Resources, or Resource Collections that have been added to Projects they are following. Daily notifications will be dispatched every day at 6:00 a.m. and weekly notifications every Sunday at 6:00 a.m (per the time the server is set to).

Additionally, readers can opt to have Manifold send an email in real time when a reply has been made to one of their annotations or comments.

Notification settings can be accessed and adjusted from the user icon dropdown in the top right corner of the screen or by clicking on the Notification Settings button at the bottom of the Edit Profile screen.

[Readers](../backend/users.md#reader), [Project Creators](../backend/users.md#project-creator), or [Marketeers](../backend/users.md#marketeer) who have permissions to modify specific Projects in the backend can opt to receive notification in realtime of all comments and annotations made to those projects by selecting Yes to “Notify You of All Comments and Annotations.”

Likewise, users who have either [Editor](../backend/users.md#editor) or [Administrator](../backend/users.md#administrator) roles who select that option will be notified of all comments and annotations in realtime for all Projects on the instance.

When enabled, notifications will be triggered by the following events:

* Public annotation created
* Public annotation updated with new text
* Private annotation converted to public annotation

Administrators, alone, also have the option to be notified of flagged comments in realtime.
