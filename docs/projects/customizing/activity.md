The Activity section of the project page allows users to selectively review and remove events that are displayed as tiles on the Recent Activity blade on the project's frontend homepage. Events are created when new texts and resources are added and when Manifold pulls in Tweets.

Users can search for events and filter results by the kinds of activity: `Text Added`, `Project Created`.

To remove an event from appearing in the frontend, simply click on the red trashcan icon in the lower right of the event's card.
