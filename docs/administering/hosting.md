## Third Party Hosting Recommendations

Manifold can be successfully hosted in cloud computing environments. We think that [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) is a good, low-cost solution with a simple, reliable backup strategy. We've also seen users have good luck hosting Manifold on [AWS EC2 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) and [Google Cloud Compute instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/)
