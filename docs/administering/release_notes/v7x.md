Jennifer Jones, who announced Tuesday that she will retire from four-player curling at the conclusion of this season, will play her first game in her final Scotties Tournament of Hearts appearance Saturday at 1 p.m. when her team from Winnipeg and Altona, Man., takes on Nova Scotia’s Team Heather Smith.asdas

All four sheets will be in play on opening night, with the other first-night matchups featuring four-time defending champs Team Canada, Team Kerri Einarson (Gimli, Man.) playing Quebec’s Team Laurie St-Georges (Dollard-des-Ormeaux/Laval); 2013 Canadian Under-21 champ Corryn Brown and her team from Kamloops, B.C., plays 2023 Scotties bronze-medallists Team Northern Ontario, skipped by Krista McCarville (Thunder Bay); and Saskatchewan’s Team Skylar Ackerman (Saskatoon) is up against Prince Edward Island’s Team Jane DiCarlo (Crapaud) in a battle of Scotties rookie skips.

While Einarson, vice-skip Val Sweeting, second Shannon Birchard and lead Briane Harris (the team is rounded out by alternate Krysten Karwacki and coach Reid Carruthers) are chasing a record fifth consecutive Scotties win, there are others in the field chasing history at the same time.

Jones is looking for a record seventh Scotties title; she currently shares the record for Scotties wins with former teammate Jill Officer and Colleen Jones (who is coaching Nova Scotia’s Team Heather Smith at the 2024 Scotties).

Birchard, meanwhile, would join that select company of six-time winners with a win in Calgary. In addition to her four titles won with Team Einarson, she won her first Scotties title in 2018 as a member of Team Jennifer Jones.

Thirteen provincial/territorial champions (Nunavut withdrew from the event last month), defending champions Team Canada and four teams that qualified based on based on Canadian Team Ranking System standings will be in Calgary.

—————-

Teams will play a complete eight-game round robin within their pools. From there, the top three teams in each pool advance to the playoffs.

There will be no tiebreakers; if teams are tied for a playoff spot, head-to-head results will be the first tiebreaker, and if that doesn’t resolve the tie, Last-Shot Draw rankings will rank the teams — the same formula used at World Championship events and the Winter Olympics.

The playoff format will see the first-place team from Pool A meeting second place from Pool B, and vice versa, in the first round of the playoffs at noon (all times Mountain) on Feb. 23, with the winners going directly to the Page playoff 1-2 game, while the losers meet the third-place finishers in the pools Feb. 23 at 6 p.m. The winners of those games will advance to the Page playoff 3-4 game.

The standard Page playoffs commence with the winner of the Page 1v2 game on Saturday, Feb. 24, at 6 p.m., advancing directly to the final, and the loser plays the winner of the Page 3v4 game (scheduled for noon on Saturday) in the semifinal.

The semifinal (Sunday, Feb. 25, at noon) winner takes on the winner of the Page 1v2 game in the final at 6 p.m. on Sunday. The winner will represent Canada at the 2024 BKT Tires World Women’s Curling Championship March 16-24 in Sydney, N.S.

Here’s a look at how the two pools are set up:

Note: Because some matchups featuring the pre-qualified teams were pre-set as part of ticket marketing campaigns, the pools were adjusted accordingly but kept as even as possible. The Curling Canada Athletes Council was informed of this possibility, and the methodology that would be used to keep the pools equitable, in the fall. The average overall CTRS ranking for Pool A is 27.33, and for 29.1 for Pool.
