Manifold uses Environment variables to orchestrate and configure its various services.

### Package Install

Environment variables for the Manifold API and Client are stored in `/var/opt/manifold/etc/`. Do not edit these files directly, as they are generated anew each time you run `manifold-ctl reconfigure`. Instead, edit the master configuration file at `etc/manifold/manifold.rb`. To inject environment variables for the API, expose your environment variables as a hash at `manifold_api['env']`. Remember, this file is a Ruby file and should be valid Ruby syntax.

```ruby
#### Add custom environment to Manifold API
manifold_api['env'] = {
  "FOO" => "bar"
}
```

As always, once you've updated this file, run `sudo manifold-ctl reconfigure` to apply your changes. Look at `/var/opt/manifold/etc/api-env.sh` to confirm that your additons to the environment persisted.

### Other installation types

In a Docker environment, you can pass environment variables to services using the Docker Compose file. When developing locally or deploying from source, it's also possible to set variables in the application's root `.env` file.

### Available Variables

The following environment variables can be used to adjust Manifold's behavior. Variables can be exposed to the Client and/or the API services, [C] and [A] accordingly.

It is also possible to manage Manifold settings through the environment. See our documentation on [managing settings](/docs/administering/configuring/managing_settings#from-the-environment) for more information.
