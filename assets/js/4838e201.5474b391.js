Digital humanities projects, on the other hand, are designed to be iterative in nature, with the potential for revision and expansion as knowledge of a subject evolves. Integrating university press publication with emerging practices of digital humanities scholarship, Manifold Scholarship breaks from the prevalent format-based terms \u201cprint,\u201d \u201cebook,\u201d and \u201cenhanced ebook,\u201d defining scholarly work instead as either \u201citerative\u201d or \u201cstatic,\u201d with the latter term encompassing both print editions and their replicated, fixed ebook editions.

We are asking authors to consider, from the very beginning of the research process, developing and sharing their project iteratively. Research materials, filmed images, field notes, ethnographic materials, sketches, maps, audio recordings, interviews, and other forms of research that are used to write the monograph will have a place on Manifold so that scholars can share their work as it is being researched and written. One of the greatest strengths of the university press is creating efficient and replicable publishing procedures; as a part of Manifold Scholarship, we will work collaboratively with authors on pilot projects, establishing a set of procedures and best practices for preparing the materials for web-based publication, while refining the production workflow needed to publish Manifold projects while simultaneously producing static formats."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(i.h2,{id:"the-next-steps",children:"The Next Steps"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(i.p,{children:"We are excited about Manifold Scholarship and about sharing our progress and our thinking as the project develops.
