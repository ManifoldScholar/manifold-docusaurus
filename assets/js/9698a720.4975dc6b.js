This includes new interfaces for creating texts, text sections, and text assets, for managing the section order within a text and the text\u2019s table of contents, and for updating the properties of text sections and text assets.

The editor features both HTML and Rich Text editing modes. In the ingest process, Manifold generates HTML for each text section.

While not exposing the full functionality of editing raw HTML, RTE mode makes editing texts approachable for users without any technical background."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In addition to editing in the backend interface, ingestion is now possible for individual text sections. Together with the Manifold editor, this allows users flexibility in updating their Manifold texts: instant adjustments can be made in the editor; larger text updates can be made in the author\u2019s text editor of choice and the section document reingested. To handle the likelihood that Manifold texts will now change more frequently, v8 includes a more robust algorithm for placing annotations from a prior version of a text section in the new version, and if the annotation cannot be placed, ensuring a user can access a list of their annotations on prior versions."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Finally, authoring introduces a new option for text stylesheets.

However, that initial release had some limitations, among them that the user\u2019s place in a text was not maintained after saving an annotation. v8 includes a significant refactor of how focus and selection are handled in the Reader. Now, when a user creates or views an annotation, Manifold restores focus and selection to that annotation when the drawer is closed. If they escape out of the annotation menu, or unhighlight a highlight, the caret goes right to where they left off. The team believes all this is working such that one never loses their place in the text! Moreover, by isolating selection and focus from one another and managing them individually, the experience is consistent across browsers in v8."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"other-features",children:"Other Features"}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(n.ul,{children:["\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.li,{children:"Manifold now supports MathML!
