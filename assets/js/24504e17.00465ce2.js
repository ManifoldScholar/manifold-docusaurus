The development team thought long and hard about what server-side language to use, which was mainly a debate about the relative merits of using Ruby or Javascript on the server. While we have many years of experience working with PHP, and understand that it is still a popular, easy choice among academic developers, we felt strongly that the advantages of Ruby\u2014strong OOP support, support for more functional styles, cleaner and more consistent syntax, and the maturity of Rails\u2014outweighed the disadvantages of a more complex execution model and smaller (but by no means small) developer community. ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://laravel.com/"},"Laravel"),", the current leading PHP framework, for all its notable strengths, lacks the completeness and maturity of Rails and Active Record. Our choice to go with edge rails, rather than stable Rails 4.x, was driven by the fact that our server-side component is ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html"},"only serving an API"),", and Rails 5 will eventually ship with an api-only flag. This means that many aspects of Rails\u2014the view layer, sprockets, etc\u2014have been removed, making for a more lightweight framework overall. Another strong reason for choosing Rails was the presence of a strong HTML/XML parsing library in ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://nokogiri.org"},"Nokogiri"),". Manifold deals heavily (but not exclusively) in EPUBs, which are HTML documents.

One of our goals on this project is to make Manifold as easy as possible to integrate into a presses existing infrastructure and environment, and following an established API specification helps us with that goal.

Both are relatively new Javascript libraries (or frameworks, depending on how you look at things) that are rapidly gaining mindshare and popularity among front-end developers.

Over time, client-side development has become quite complex, and it's our feeling that while Angular can work well on some projects, it doesn't do enough to reduce that complexity.

For our purposes, the biggest challenge is to ensure that there is content loaded on the page before the javascript executes.
