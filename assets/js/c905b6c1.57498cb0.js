We\u2019ll all be meeting halfway between Portland and NYC in Minneapolis, seeing each other in person for the first time since the pandemic began.\\n\\nFive years in, it seems like a good time to reflect on a digital publishing platform that has grown and evolved significantly since the launch of its first version in 2018. Now used by over thirty publishers, many of whom began through a pilot program generously funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Manifold just released its seventh version earlier this year.\\n\\nHome to hundreds of publications, many of them enhanced with video and audio resources, highlighted and annotated by readers around the world, Manifold was designed to extend the print book into the digital space, without sacrificing the beautiful reading experience that a well-designed print book provides. It remains an open source project, benefitting from community feedback and community-funded features.\\n\\nWith the new journal features of v7, Manifold now hosts publications such as [Ada](https://fembotcollective.manifoldapp.org/projects/ada-16-05ea0df0-6162-412e-b557-b79f5c37b5ee), [Cultural Critique](https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/cultural-critique), and the [Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy](https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/about-the-journal/), creating unique digital hubs where these journals\u2019 reader communities can meet and interact. A lot of time and thought has gone into improving the platform for open educational resources (OERs) as well, in collaboration with Manifold publishers such as [Affordable Learning Georgia](https://alg.manifoldapp.org/) and the [Open Education Network](https://open.umn.edu/blog/open-education-network-launches-manifold-pilot), allowing teachers to create and curate Project Collections across Manifold instances, making it possible to frame an entire syllabus within Manifold. We\u2019ve continued to see the platform used to create digital editions of public domain texts that can be highlighted, annotated, and discussed in public or private reading groups in the classroom.\\n\\nThe analytics features have been a favorite of publishers and authors since they were launched in v6\u2014and I can say firsthand what a pleasure it is to be able to report the exact number of engagements, highlights, annotations on an author\u2019s text. Authors continue to get excited about the expanding capabilities of Manifold to enhance and expand their work, and the fact that Open Access allows their work to resonate broadly and internationally.\\n\\nOf course, each press has its own reasons for turning to a platform like Manifold. At a recent Manifold Community Meetup, Managing Editor Deirdre Mullervy of [Gallaudet University Press ](https://gallaudetupress.manifoldapp.org/)explained that the press had received a directive from their administration to include more sign language video in their texts, which was what led them to the Manifold platform initially. They have since expanded their offerings significantly, and released a recent [guide to bilingual Deaf Education Studies](https://gallaudetupress.manifoldapp.org/projects/guidelines-for-multilingual-deaf-education-teacher-preparation-programs) that has become one of the most visited resources on their site.\\n\\nHere at Minnesota, [our Manifold instance](https://manifold.umn.edu/) now hosts almost 200 projects, far outstripping our initial projections. It has allowed us to release a dozen monographs open access, through the [TOME program](https://www.openmonographs.org/), and several more through the new [Fellowships Open Book program at the NEH.](https://www.neh.gov/grants/odh/FOBP) It has also allowed us to work out individual arrangements with both new and backlist authors to open their work through Manifold, in cases where their universities or funding agencies have resources to support open access. Authors who envision multimodal works, or iterative projects that will be published in stages, come to us directly\u2014sometimes specifically because of our association with Manifold. The platform\u2019s [ongoing accessibility work](https://manifoldscholar.github.io/manifold-docusaurus/docs/accessibility) has informed our own efforts to make Minnesota books more accessible to all readers.\\n\\nA recent Modern Philology review of [Whitney Trettien\u2019s Cut/Copy/Paste](https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/cut-copy-paste), which has over 400 resources added to its Manifold edition, gives a sense of how far the platform has come. \u201cThe printed version of Cut/Copy/Paste is, unusually, no longer the nimblest or richest form to read for review,\u201d reviewer Georgina Wilson wrote. \u201cThrough a spiraling array of content ... this volume practices the very affordances of multimedia publishing that it describes.\u201d\\n\\nWith authoring functionality and a payment authorization gateway coming in its next version, now is a great time for university presses to check out [the Manifold website](https://manifoldapp.org/) where you can learn a lot more about all the possibilities of the platform and start envisioning your own Manifold instance. Or just spend some time with a Manifold text to see how it looks and feels. For all the growth of the platform and the community around it, Manifold has thrived by keeping the reader at the center of it all.\\n\\nFor more #UPWeek posts showcasing the essential work of university presses, please [visit this link.](https://upweek.up.hcommons.org/celebrate/up-week-2022/blog-tour/)\\n\\nEric Lundgren  \\nOutreach and Development Manager  \\nUniversity of Minnesota Press"},{"id":"v7-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/v7-update","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-22-v7-update.md","title":"A Belated Version 7 Update","description":"A belated update on the Version 7 release: We were so thrilled to share Manifold version 7.0 with our community in August.

And so we inaugurated Manifold Community Meetups: a quarterly virtual meetup for Manifold community members to share practices, discuss strategies, ask questions, troubleshoot difficulties, and learn from each other. \\n\\nOur first meetup was held on November 17 from 3-4 pm and featured short presentations on two wonderful projects: *[The Greater Chaco Landscape](http://read.upcolorado.com/projects/the-greater-chaco-landscape)* from University Press of Colorado, and *[Race &/in America at Brown University](https://digitalpublications.brown.edu/projects/project-collection/race-and-in-america)*. Both projects bring together a variety of media in an exciting hybrid publication. \\n\\nDarrin Pratt, director of UP Colorado, discussed the creation of *The Greater Chaco Landscape*, a book of essays based on a seminar held at Crow Canyon Archaeological Center in August 2017 that addressed the conflict between Native communities and energy development in the Chaco Canyon. The open access version of this work on UP Colorado\'s Manifold instance hosts video footage of the individual seminars that served as the underpinnings of each chapter as well as interviews with Native elders and scholars that explain the importance of the Chaco Canyon to their culture and society. We also got to hear from two members of the core development team for *Race &/in America*: Allison Levy, Digital Scholarship Editor for the Brown University Library\u2019s Digital Publications Initiative, and Crystal Busch, Brown Univeersity\u2019s Designer for Online Publications. Similar to *The Greater Chaco Landscape*, *Race &/in America* began as a live event - a panel discussion series held by the Centre for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America at Brown University that investigated the long legacy of anti-Black racism in America. *Race &/in America* is an eight-part open access series that contains videos of the original panel discussions alongside expanded content and resources. Darrin, Allison, and Crystal shared their experiences organizing and supporting these amazing projects. We then had time to break into discussion groups for press, teaching, and library users, where we got to talk about what has worked and what has been a challenge in developing Manifold projects, sustaining a Manifold instance, and training users.

Manifold relies on Elasticsearch for its search functionality, and Elasticsearch in turn uses the vulnerable log4j logging library. The version that ships with Manifold is vulnerable, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the vulnerability can be easily exploited. Manifold does not expose its Elasticsearch service to the public, and all connections to it are mediated through the API. We\u2019ve investigated, and it\u2019s our view that no user input from a public Manifold instance can make its way into log4j logs, which means that Manifold does not appear to be vulnerable. Furthermore, the Elasticsearch team claims that version 7, which is what is in the Manifold package, is not susceptible to remote code execution.\\n\\nThat said, it pays to be especially cautious in these matters, and we\u2019re working on 6.0.1 packages that will include updates to Elasticsearch and log4j. As of earlier this morning, we were still waiting on Elasticsearch 7.16.1 to be released, and it will take us a few days to build and test new packages. I expect we\u2019ll release 6.0.1 on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week, which will be an easy upgrade for everyone already on v6. It should also be easy for people on v5, as we haven\u2019t had any significant reports of upgrade problems.\\n\\nIf you installed Manifold from one of our packages (for Ubuntu or CentOS), you can easily mitigate the problem by adding one line to a file and restarting Elasticsearch. To do this, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Shell into your server and edit `/var/opt/manifold/elasticsearch/jvm.options` as root.\\n2. Add this text on a new line at the end of the file and save it: `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`\\n3. Restart Elasticsearch to pick up the new configuration: `sudo manifold-ctl restart elasticsearch`\\n\\nIf you are hosting Manifold through Manifold Digital Services, rest assured that we will be releasing a similar mitigation in the next couple hours to all instances.\\n\\nWe will also publish updated docker images when 6.0.1 is released later this week.\\n\\n\u2014Zach"},{"id":"oa-week-2021-project-spotlight-4","metadata":{"permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/oa-week-2021-project-spotlight-4","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-29-OA-week-spotlight4.md","title":"OA Week 2021 Project Spotlight 4","description":"The Mill on The Floss","date":"2021-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":4,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"oa-week-2021-project-spotlight-4","title":"OA Week 2021 Project Spotlight 4"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Log4j2 Vulnerability","permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/log42j"},"nextItem":{"title":"OA Week 2021 Project Spotlight 3","permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/oa-week-2021-project-spotlight-3"}},"content":"## The Mill on The Floss\\n\\nAs part of [Open Access Week](http://www.openaccessweek.org/), Manifold is featuring interviews with the creators of exemplary projects that use Manifold\'s capabilities to the fullest. Our fourth installment in this series is an \\"Anthropocene Edition\\" of [The Mill on The Floss](https://uw.manifoldapp.org/projects/the-mill-on-the-floss). We interviewed its creators, Megan Butler, Francesca Colonnese, and Mara Minion, about this exciting project. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## How did the project come together? Who was involved?\\n\\nOur Manifold project around George Eliot\u2019s The Mill on the Floss grew out of a suggestion from our professor, Jesse Oak Taylor, for an alternative to the classic quarter-end seminar paper. The project allowed us to flip the script: instead of incorporating the novel into our essays, we incorporated our research into the novel. This also gave us a useful perspective on what is involved in creating a scholarly edition of a text. What and how much should we include? How do we frame our edition as an ecocritical intervention into the novel? How can we bring to the novel a new understanding of the role of nature, including how that fits with modern concerns about the Anthropocene?\\n\\nOur team included three graduate students and three undergraduate seniors, each with an assigned number of annotations to pair with the text and each with a section of the introduction to write.  Two of us handled the coding and internal design of the project. By having a project that bridged many talents and levels of scholarship, we were able to produce something that felt valuable to have live on the internet at the end of single quarter.\\n\\n## What are your favorite aspects of this project?\\n\\nIt is atypical in our graduate program that literary studies seminars invite experimentation. As a result of breaking free from the research paper, we were able to produce work that extended our skills at writing to a reader who was not known to us, one beyond the classroom. We still imagined our audience was an intelligent reader, which felt freeing and interesting and left us less nervous about taking some risks with our ideas. Particularly since literary studies often avoids collaborative models of producing critique, we enjoyed working together. Our annotations were a lot like weekly discussion board posts but more fun. This was a good reminder that knowledge production can come in bite size chunks rather than article or dissertation length works. \\n\\n## What Manifold features (i.e. reading groups, social media integration, etc.) did you use to achieve your goals for this project?\\n\\nWe mostly used Manifold\u2019s text digestion and annotation tools for this specific project. The ability to create a robust edition was simplified by the Manifold platform. We found the platform quick and accessible for a group using it for the first time. Although we didn\u2019t use the reading group feature to bunch our annotations, that would have been another option.\\n\\n## What challenges did you encounter and how did you overcome them?\\n\\nFrom time to time, we had some design challenges that left us feeling hemmed in.  For example, we wished the annotations had more linking options\u2014instead of jumping to a chapter head, we wanted to link right to a passage. Manifold also offers limited tools for locating the interactions of people with the text outside of reading groups. We can see from the number of comments that this edition has been of use to others, but it is difficult to interact with these comments, even as project authors, and we would love to ask the annotators if our edition helped them.\\n\\n## What sort of impact have you seen from this project being open access?\\n\\nWe had a great time presenting our project to the class and stepping out of the seminar paper norm\u2014the rest of the class and the professor were surprised at how we enlivened the novel in new ways.  Manifold also let our work for the quarter live on, which is so different from the paper that gets dropped in a folder and is rarely seen again. We know that others have been able to enjoy and read our work but look forward to other methods of tracking usage, like Manifold\u2019s new analytics tool.\\n\\n***Megan Butler*** is a PhD student at the University of Washington whose writing and research seek uses for literature in the ongoing crises of forced migration and refugee care.

Our third installment in this series is [The Negro and The Nation](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/projects/hubert-harrison-the-negro-and-the-nation). We interviewed Justin Rogers-Cooper, a Professor at CUNY LaGuardia and the Graduate Center, about this collaborative project. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## How did the project come together? Who was involved?\\n\\nThis project is partly a story about the network effects of the CUNY Graduate Center, where I got my PhD in English and was later appointed as a faculty member in the Master of Liberal Studies (MALS) program. \\nIn Spring 2019, I learned about Manifold from Krystyna (Krysia) Michael through spontaneous social and professional occasions common among Grad Center folks. At the time, Krysia was on the development team for Manifold at the Grad Center working as an open educational technologist. We both knew a mutual colleague of ours, Matt Gold, who was directing the Digital Humanities initiatives at the Grad Center. Through Krysia and fellow technologist Jojo Karlin, I discovered how to adapt Manifold into my upcoming class for the MALS program, \u201cAmerican Culture and Values.\u201d Through their generous time and instruction, I learned more about the platform and its capacities, and was able to design an interactive assignment around the recovery of Hubert Harrison\u2019s out of print book from 1917, The Negro and the Nation. \\n\\n## What are your favorite aspects of this project?\\n\\nManifold lends itself to different forms of collaboration, and that\u2019s one its best aspects. The Manifold team, led by Krysia and Jojo, generously provided my class and me with tips, resources, and support from the planning stage forward. Jojo actually came to my class and started getting the students excited to learn more. Krysia provided tons of technical assistance that was necessary to actually realizing the project on the platform, and provided superb feedback on the assignment as it evolved around the Harrison text. \\n\\nOf course, another layer of collaboration took place in and out of the class. The project, punningly entitled \u201cThe Manifold Harrison,\u201d became a center of gravity for classroom discussion throughout the semester. Since one of the key aspects of our assignment was annotating the text, many of our discussions focused on how to connect passages from the text to other works of American Studies we were reading. As students read each other\u2019s annotations, their comments and feedback led to recurring conversations between them. Many took place before and after class. Having a common, collective assignment on a core project like The Manifold Harrison thus spurred the sparks of collegiality one always hopes to ignite in a class.  \\n\\n## What Manifold features (i.e. reading groups, social media integration, etc.) did you use to achieve your goals for this project?\\n\\nThe main feature of this project is the annotation tool, where students could make formal comments on certain passages and link them to relevant media, and which allowed them to make connections, comments, and citations. \\n\\n## What challenges did you encounter and how did you overcome them?\\n\\nAs I share in an upcoming conference presentation with Matt, Krysia, and other Manifold scholars in the CUNY system, I encountered one expected challenge and a couple unexpected ones (by the way, check out the awesome work of [Christina Katopodis](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/read/the-great-lawsuit/section/a14cc249-0f21-4e02-89c8-f21c7c2c7d13), [Jason Neilsen](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/read/337def73-85ba-4e2a-b1d1-4033d825036f/section/910c3b6a-dd73-462c-8aa8-92edbf7a8eaf), and [Paul Hebert](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/projects/huck-finn)!. \\n\\nI knew that having CUNY students learn another online platform can sometimes be frustrating for them. I addressed this like most faculty address technology in the classroom: through patience, demonstration, encouragement, and modeling. If you\u2019re not creating and sharing resources about how to use a platform, and not actively modeling how to complete the work in class, it can be difficult to have students meet one\u2019s expectations and deadlines. This required that I use some class time somewhat differently than in prior MALS courses. \\n\\nWhat I didn\u2019t expect was the students\u2019 initial intimidation at creating permanent \\nannotations in a published text, which I attribute to the \u2018imposter syndrome\u2019 common among graduate students and to their respect for Harrison\u2019s intellect. To address the former, I made clear that their reactions, connections, and comments upon The Negro and the Nation were necessary elements of \u2018recovering\u2019 Harrison and his work. They were not only \u2018recent voices\u2019 on the text, but some of the only ones, sadly, that were identifying passages of interest to American Studies and to a wider public. In short, their efforts were important, but also, inevitably, novel. \\n\\nI also asked them to look upon the permanence of their contributions as a kind of meaningful gift to future students, who would learn from their annotations and add to them. Feeling like they were part of an on-going project ended up relaxing them, in part because they imagined they were writing to an audience like themselves.\\n\\n## What sort of impact have you seen from this project being open access?\\n\\nFor one, it\u2019s compelling to me that I was able to assign chapters from The Negro and the \\nNation to my students at LaGuardia Community College the semester after the recovery project in my Masters class. They read both Harrison and the annotations made by my MALS students, and that helped them understand the text. \\n\\nFurther, I committed to solely assigning OER texts at LaGuardia several years ago, and I was pleased to offer my two-year students a readable, accessible, and mobile-ready text to complement my traditional menu of PDFs and occasional commercial websites. Manifold is a powerful platform within the ecosystem of open access texts for both undergraduate and graduate students, in part because it models a kind of dynamic, media-rich, and mobile-friendly reading experience that students so often associate with for-profit apps and sites. For me, part of Manifold\u2019s value comes from its ability to socialize the reading process, and to provide tools for collaboration around \u2018academic\u2019 reading practices that are competitive with, and more than equal to, the online experiences students naturally couple with platform capitalism. \\n\\nIn this respect, I think publishing Harrison\u2019s book on Manifold as an open access text would make him smile. He was, after all, an avowed socialist. I have no doubt he would be delighted to learn that an advanced platform like Manifold was publishing and distributing his work to CUNY students, but also to readers everywhere. In a small way, I see that impact as part of his legacy, not just ours. \\n\\n**Justin Rogers-Cooper** is an English professor at LaGuardia Community College, and a faculty member in the Master of Arts in Liberal Studies program at the CUNY Graduate Center.

Our second installment in this series is [The Greater Chaco Landscape](http://read.upcolorado.com/projects/the-greater-chaco-landscape). We interviewed Darrin Pratt, director of the University Press of Colorado, about this amazing project. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## How did the project come together? Who was involved?\\n\\nThe Greater Chaco Landscape originated with a seminar held at Crow Canyon Archaeological Center in August 2017. This seminar brought together academics and Native scholars from the tribal communities who have a vested interest in Chaco Canyon to address \\"potential conflicts between energy development and Chacoan archaeology across the San Juan Basin.\u201d Individual seminar presentations, which provided the underpinnings for the volume\u2019s written chapters, were filmed, and after the initial seminar, Durango filmmaker Larry Ruiz recorded additional footage\u2014at Chaco Canyon itself\u2014of Acoma (Haaku), Din\xe9 (Navajo), Hopi, and A:shiwi (Zuni) tribal elders and scholars talking about the significance of Chaco to their people. The seminar, filmmaking, and book production were funded by the National Park Service and organized by Steve Lekson (University of Colorado Boulder), Ruth Van Dyke (University of Binghamton) and Carrie Heitman (University of Nebraska). Ruth Van Dyke and Carrie Heitman served as the volume editors for both the online and print editions of the book.\\n\\n## What are your favorite aspects of this project?\\n\\nMy favorite aspect of the project is the integration of the video and book content, particularly the inclusion of video only chapters that are referenced in the print book but can only be viewed by visiting the Manifold edition. This format made possible the inclusion of the perspectives of the Acoma (Haaku), Din\xe9 (Navajo), Hopi, and A:shiwi (Zuni) tribal elders and scholars.\\n\\n## What Manifold features (i.e. reading groups, social media integration, etc.) did you use to achieve your goals for this project?\\n\\nFollowing on my last answer, obviously Manifold\u2019s ability to handle multimedia publications was crucial, but we also made use of the site as an informal preprint server, following the example of some early Manifold projects that were posted as works in process. We made the seminar videos available three years before the book was ready and the later videos about six months before publication, along with the table of contents and a brief synopsis of the forthcoming book, making the material publicly available in a far more timely fashion than is typically the case with our scholarly titles.\\n\\n## What challenges did you encounter and how did you overcome them?\\n\\n In all honesty, the biggest challenges for us involved integrating the videos\u2014which were quite large files\u2014into the EPUB. This was such a challenge that we initially published the book on Manifold with the same print links via DOI out to the Manifold resources while we continued to try to resolve the issues we were having. Ultimately, thanks to the help of Manifold staff, the problem was resolved and the videos are now fully integrated into the book.\\n\\n## What sort of impact have you seen from this project being open access? \\n\\nWe have seen two impacts thus far. The first is that the book won the 2021 AAA Engaged Anthropology Award, and the fact that the video chapters were available open access almost certainly factored into the book\u2019s winning the award. In addition, the Field Museum in Chicago is designing a new exhibit around Chaco, and they are going to be featuring clips from some of the films in the book. So one public resource is building on another, which is fantastic and exactly what one hopes for with open access publications.\\n\\n**Darrin Pratt** is Director of the University Press of Colorado, a position he has held since 2000, and a past President of the Association of University Presses (2016-2017)."},{"id":"oa-week-2021-project-spotlight-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/oa-week-2021-project-spotlight-1","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-26-OA-week-spotlight1.md","title":"OA Week 2021 Project Spotlight 1","description":"As part of Open Access Week, Manifold is featuring interviews with the creators of exemplary projects that use Manifold\'s capabilities to the fullest.

Our first installment in this series is [Race &/ in America](https://digitalpublications.brown.edu/projects/project-collection/race-and-in-america). We interviewed Allison Levy from [Brown University Library Center for Digital Scholarship](https://library.brown.edu/create/cds/) about this impressive project. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## How did the project come together? Who was involved?\\n\\nOver the 2020-21 academic year, the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America at Brown University, in partnership with the Office of the Provost, undertook a systematic investigation of the foundational and enduring contemporary effects of anti-Black racism via a pioneering panel discussion series featuring Brown faculty on the role that racism plays in American public health, democracy, punishment, and more.\\n \\nRecognizing an opportunity to amplify and extend the reach and benefits of these urgent discussions designed to deepen knowledge and awareness in the service of promoting a more just and inclusive community and world, the University Library\u2019s Digital Publications Initiative developed an eight-volume open access series, \u2018Race &\u2019 in America. Created in Manifold, the digital series re-presents the compelling original panel discussions with expanded content and resources in an innovative, interactive format, heightening understanding and broadening these critical conversations.\\n \\nThe core development team for the digital series included Brown\u2019s Designer for Online Publications, Crystal Brusch; an advanced graduate student in Africana Studies, N\u2019Kosi Oates; and Special Collections Librarian Holly Snyder.\\n\\n## What Manifold features (i.e. reading groups, social media integration, etc.) did you use to achieve your goals for this project?\\n\\nEach of the eight volumes in the digital series includes:\\n \\n* A recording of one of the 90-minute panel discussions that took place throughout the 2020-2021 academic year\\n* Student Voices podcast episodes in which Brown University students engage the panelists in follow-up discussion \\n* Recommendations for entry-point materials on the subject\\n* Multimedia resource collections of readings, online exhibitions, podcasts, and other materials referenced during the panel discussions\\n* Suggestions for further exploration\\n \\nThus, we took full advantage of Manifold\u2019s most innovative features, especially multimedia integration, supplemental Resource Collections, eBooks, reading groups, and annotation tools.\\n\\n## What are your favorite aspects of this project?\\n\\nThere are so many, but I\u2019d have to say the podcast, Student Voices. The episodes feature student-led interviews of the panelists, an approach that elevates different voices and perspectives, and productively flips the conventional classroom model of conveying knowledge. We paired 17 undergraduate and graduate students with faculty, and asked each group to talk for about 10 minutes. All exceeded the limit, with some engaging in lively, compelling conversation for half an hour, so clearly the podcast provided a welcome forum for both students and faculty to continue critical discussions on key issues of today.\\n\\n## What sort of impact have you seen from this project being open access?\\n\\nWe\u2019ve had a very strong response to the digital series, both on campus and off. In fact, we designed the series to be inclusive and accessible for all communities. When selecting library resources, for example, we made sure to strike a balance between those available to Brown users and those that are publicly available. We chose Manifold precisely because it provides enduring, barrier-free access to information, and it supports universal design principles for equitable use by all persons, including those with disabilities. Brown\u2019s Digital Publications Initiative creates exciting new conditions for the production and sharing of knowledge, and is committed to disseminating that knowledge to the broadest possible audience for the greatest possible impact. Manifold helps make that possible!\\n \\nFinally, I\u2019m delighted to announce that the Library will again partner with the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America and the Office of the Provost on the Race & in America series, bringing out five new digital volumes over the course of the 2021-22 academic year. \\n\\n**Allison Levy** is Digital Scholarship Editor for the Brown University Library\u2019s Digital Publications Initiative, launched with the generous support of the Andrew W.

We reworked the user notification preferences interface for better screen reader UX. Dana\u2019s [extended commit message](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/pull/3079/commits/0aad0424cd0235f7fe6346775f9d3b02339258cf) on this issue is indicative the care and expertise we bring to accessibility concerns.\\n2. We refactored all collapsible content on the site to follow the correct ARIA design pattern. These are commonly used in the backend to add search filters and sorting options, so this was a widespread change. This will resolve [issue #2755](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/2755).\\n3. We added missing keyboard interactions to the Reading Group homepage editor. This is an improvement to the OER work, which currently exists in our main branch.\\n4. We added missing keyboard interactions to project text sorting. We already had keyboard interactions on our drag and drop lists in the backend in most cases. However, for the specific case where an entity can be dragged and dropped between two distinct lists (such as moving a text from one text category to another rather than within a category), we did not have keyboard controls. These lists, and all drag and drop lists now have full keyboard controls (including the new drag and drop lists for managing content in reading groups). This refactor resolves [issue #2678](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/2678).\\n5. We added alt text to project resources, which resolves [issue #2428](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/2428).\\n6. We applied accessible modal dialog patterns to all drawers and overlays in Manifold. This change resolved [issue #2434](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/2434). It also resolved [issue #2754](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/2754). [Issue #2425](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/2425) should also be resolved by this revision.\\n7. We resolved a header hierarchy issue in the reader. This resolves [issue #2757](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/2757).\\n8. We fixed a tab index issue in search results that made it difficult for keyboard users to navigate the content. This will resolve [issue #2969](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/2969)\\n9. We fixed a bug that had been introduced, which prevented some notifications from being rendered when certain backend forms were submitted. This error led to the problem reported in [issue #2559](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/2559), which was about the lack of screen reader notification when projects are saved.\\n10. We added screen reader support to ingestion, which resolves [issue #2743](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/2743).\\n11. We refactored the resource card markup with a focus on removing nested interactive buttons. We also improved link and button text for screen readers. This resolves [issue #2732](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/2732).\\n12. We\'re working on supporting annotation with caret browsing. This work is currently in [PR #3086](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/pull/3086). This will resolve [issue #2326](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/2326) when it\'s finished.\\n\\nAll of this work will eventually be part of the version 7 release.

Through the shared wisdom and resources of the community, Manifold plans to grow and meet the needs of established and nontraditional publishers. Underlying this structure will be the implementation of a sustainable business, Manifold Digital Services, which will offer hosting, training, and support packages. Over the next two years, with support from the Mellon Foundation, the Manifold team will rebuild the Manifold informational website (manifoldapp.org) with a significant expansion of the resources offered on the site, including a series of training videos and a broader listing of services. Development work will focus on new solutions for installation and hosting, enhancing Manifold\u2019s documentation, developing platform features for a growing and diversifying community of publishers, and establishing GDPR compliance to better serve European publishers. These activities expand the scope of Manifold\u2019s work of transforming scholarly publishing, while maintaining its commitment to open-source development and open-access publications.\\n\\nA concurrent grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, \u201cManifold in the Classroom,\u201d will enable the platform to fill a growing need for cost-effective educational solutions, with a focus on underserved communities. Adding teaching-specific features to Manifold Scholarship will expand its capacity to act as an OER platform that will engage students with dynamic, customized course versions of open-access, openly licensed, or public-domain texts. This expansion will require Manifold to build out front-end functionality for annotations and resources, but also to redesign the back end to support OER workflows such as remixing materials and evaluating student work. This grant will help Manifold accommodate scholars using the latest digital humanities methods, such as data visualization, mapping, and network analysis, in new ways but also help to make this scholarship available to vast numbers of underserved students through free, open-access course materials.\\n\\nMatthew K. Gold, Associate Professor of English and Digital Humanities at the CUNY Graduate Center, notes that\\n\\n> Manifold is already being used at a number of institutions across the country, including CUNY, the University of Washington, and Temple University, to share course materials with students, who love Manifold\u2019s beautiful design and mobile-friendly interface. With a slate of OER and teaching-focused services and features supported by grants from the Mellon Foundation, the NEH Office of Digital Humanities, and CUNY Library Services, Manifold will be well positioned to serve as a course platform across a number of academic disciplines, all while building on its already-established identity as a publishing platform for open-access texts.\\n\\nManifold will continue to expand its user base with a commitment to promoting equity and justice in the humanities\u2014not only through the educational materials it provides but through the publishers it empowers through the platform. In 2021 and 2022, Manifold will supply eighteen new publishers with a year of managed hosting and training support through Manifold Digital Services Support Grants, funded with generous support from the Mellon Foundation. As it has in previous grants, Manifold will continue to prioritize and reach out to diverse publishers, including those who represent marginalized academic communities and publish projects in service of social justice. Additionally, Manifold will continue its work with the accessibility team at the University of Washington to ensure that its platform is accessible to readers of all abilities.\\n\\nDoug Armato, Director of the University of Minnesota Press, says:\\n\\n> We\u2019re committed to enhancing Manifold\u2019s functionality in a way that serves the needs of all readers, including those who are differently abled, and also continuing to expand our community of publishers, teachers, and students to include those who represent traditionally marginalized communities and perspectives. We believe a powerful open-source publishing tool such as Manifold can do much to break down the barriers to access that still characterize higher education.\\n\\nDevelopment of Manifold Scholarship began in April 2015, and the platform launched publicly with Release 1.0 in March 2018. Publishers, and any group wanting to create open-access projects on the web, can quickly and easily turn existing files into online publications, through a robust ingestion system that can import texts from EPUB, HTML, Markdown, Microsoft Word (docx), and Google Doc source files. Currently in Release 5.1.3, notable recent improvements to the platform include Reading Groups, which allows teachers and other academic leaders to invite collaborators to collectively annotate, highlight, comment upon, and share texts; and Access Controls, which allows publishers to set limits on access to projects, enhancing the privacy options in Manifold and laying the groundwork for publishers to offer paid content through the platform."},{"id":"accessgranted","metadata":{"permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/accessgranted","source":"@site/blog/2020-05-28-access-granted.md","title":"Access Granted: Manifold 5.0 Is Here!","description":"We are delighted to announce the release of Manifold version 5.0, which is available for download here!

University presses can use Access Controls to serve exam and review copies or potentially offer paid access to course texts, opening up new revenue streams through the platform.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nOur approach to access controls embraces the needs of different organizations, allowing publishers to craft custom messaging around why materials are restricted and how to gain access to them. We have built in scheduling features so publishers can choose the terms of access, whether that be a semester, a year, or otherwise. In the months to come, we plan to add a suite of complementary features to this architecture, including the ability to add large numbers of users simultaneously through ingestion of CSV files. Publishers can integrate shopping carts on their own or contact the Manifold Digital Services team to discuss options for support and assistance.\\n\\nManifold is an open-source project, and it is oriented toward open access in conception and development. However, as our community of publishers has grown, and we\u2019ve listened to feedback from our users, it has become clear that Manifold publishers need the flexibility of this new feature to carry out their work, serve their communities, and sustain themselves in an increasingly complex and challenging digital environment. This feature will give publishers power over their projects and allow them to offer projects as open or restricted, as their specific needs and objectives evolve.\\n\\nFor a more detailed rundown of this feature, and the other enhancements in version 5.0, please check out this guided video tour by lead developer Zach Davis.\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/423616600\\" width=\\"640\\" height=\\"360\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n<p><a href=\\"https://vimeo.com/423616600\\">New Features in Manifold v5</a> from <a href=\\"https://vimeo.com/user25947133\\">Zach Davis</a> on <a href=\\"https://vimeo.com\\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\\n\\nWe look forward to hearing about how you will use Access Controls on your Manifold installation, and answering your questions on [Slack](https://manifold-slackin.herokuapp.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold)."},{"id":"happyholidaysfrommanifold","metadata":{"permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/happyholidaysfrommanifold","source":"@site/blog/2019-12-20-happy-holidays-from-manifold.md","title":"Happy holidays from Manifold!","description":"Here\'s to 2019!

We\'re happy to be working together and with all of you.\\n\\n## Doug\\n\\nI\u2019m excited that two of the \u201citerative,\u201d work-in-progress book projects we launched in 2017 on the Manifold platform \u2014 Whitney Trettien\u2019s [_Cut/Copy/Paste_](https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/cut-copy-paste) and Darren Wershler, Lori Emerson, and Jussi Parikka\u2019s [_The Lab Book_](https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/the-lab-book) \u2014 are now on the verge of being completed projects, to be launched on the platform and in print this coming year.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Matt\\n\\nI\u2019m going to take the liberty of sharing two great moments: first, the moment we launched the [_Debates in the Digital Humanities_](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/) series on Manifold. The original DDH site, launched in 2013, was the early prototype for Manifold, so it was great to move the whole series onto the fully featured platform, and it was all the more impactful because the series has grown so much, allowing us -- through the goodwill of our fantastic publisher, the University of Minnesota Press -- to release all volumes in the series on an open-access basis. I love having the work shared so widely and openly, and I\u2019m grateful to the Press for allowing that to happen, to Cast Iron Coding for moving ALL of the comments over, and to the CUNY Graduate Center for funding that work. I\u2019m also so excited to see the [CUNY instance of Manifold](http://cuny.manifoldapp.org/) take off, and one of my favorite moments of the year came when Justin Rogers-Cooper and Krystyna Michael launched Hubert Harrison\u2019s [_The Negro and the Nation_](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/projects/hubert-harrison-the-negro-and-the-nation), an out-of-print text newly available thanks to their work. Justin sent one of the most detailed thank-you messages I\u2019ve ever seen to Krysia and Jojo for their work on the project; it was amazing to see how much time and effort they had put into helping CUNY faculty get their projects up and running, and also excellent to see that work fully acknowledged and appreciated. We\u2019re looking forward to continuing that work in the new year!\\n\\n## Susan\\n\\nThe expanding community of publishers and authors is what is most exciting for me about Manifold; as we end 2019 we have more than 30 groups with installations! Our community is publishing journals, conference-related publications, and open educational resources and textbooks--far more uses than we had originally envisioned in 2015 when we started making Manifold. We all look forward to helping more publishers get started with Manifold in 2020 and seeing the creativity and new ideas that they will bring to our community.\\n\\n## Terence\\n\\nI had the opportunity to travel all over the map this past year, visiting in-person will each of our pilots. I\'m grateful to them all for their generosity of spirit and time, for their warm welcomes, engaging conversation, and the amazing dining experiences they cultivated. But if I had to choose just one instance that defines my year, I\'d say it was this past October when I was visiting with Dr. Rossetta Ross at Spelman College in Atlanta. We had finished a rather long training session, and Dr. Ross looked at me with intensity and remarked that she didn\'t realize everything Manifold could do when she applied for the pilot, that this changed everything for her, allowing her to do things for her colleagues and her students that she wouldn\'t otherwise be able to do. What a moment and what a feeling of accomplishment that imbued. Thank you, Dr. Ross, and thank you to all the other pilots who continue to help team Manifold make the platform a meaningful and useful means of engaging with and enhancing scholarship.\\n\\n## Eric\\n\\nOne of the highlights of 2019 for me was the release of the open-access edition of Cynthia and Julie Willett\u2019s [_Uproarious_](https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/uproarious), a feminist study of comedy and subversion. I remember getting excited about the Manifold edition for the first time in one of our new projects meetings, and later I worked with the great folks at Emory University to secure funding through the [TOME](https://www.openmonographs.org/)program. So it really felt good to tweet out the announcement of the release in December! Of course the Manifold Twitter had way too many highlights to list; maybe just [follow us](https://twitter.com/ManifoldScholar)?\\n\\n## Zach\\n\\nOne moment that stands out for me was when, back in February, author Robin Sloan highlighted the Manifold edition of Grant Wythoff\u2019s book on Hugo Gernsback in [his email newsletter](https://desert.glass/newsletter/week-7/). I\u2019m a big fan of Sloan\u2019s newsletter and I love the way it bounces between internet curiosities, digital media, economics, cultural trends, and thoughts about what the future holds for the business of writing and publishing. Describing the Gernsback book, Sloan wrote \u201cWhen it comes to these academic web publishing platforms, I am always a great fan of the vision but often a reluctant reader of the text; the platforms tend towards heaviness and clunkiness. Manifold is neither, and maybe more importantly, it\u2019s a great match for this book, which is naturally random-access.\u201d That bit of feedback has stuck with me because it hit on so many of the things that are challenging and engaging about this project. With Manifold, we\u2019ve tried to build a platform that fundamentally gets out of the way of the reading experience while also bringing a little bit of design, a little personality to the encounter between the reader and the text. I love the feeling of holding a fine book in my hands. Can we get to something _like_ that feeling on a screen? What would that look like, if we could?I really value the act of reading, which I often think of as a kind of discourse or friendship in which my mind gets tangled up in a sometimes ethical, sometimes rhetorical engagement with other minds. What can a reading and publishing platform add to that engagement? Reading\u2019s pretty great and, after all, the physical book is about as perfect an object as humanity has come up with. The act of reading on a computer starts out from such a degraded place that it\u2019s no small task figuring out how to add something to that experience.So, It\u2019s a great feeling, hearing from a reader, especially one whom I admire, that the platform helped him engage the material in a way that felt exploratory and freeing rather than limiting, that it got out of his way and maybe brought a little joy into the act of engaging another mind. I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled to be part of a project that gives me a chance to be involved in ongoing conversations about how knowledge is produced, how it\u2019s disseminated, and how it\u2019s consumed. To that end, I\u2019ve loved meeting Manifold publishers, authors, and readers in person over the last year, and I am so looking forward to seeing many of you again in 2020!\\n\\n## Dana\\n\\nAlong with releasing some exciting new features this year, the highlight of 2019 for me was the tremendous progress we made in improving Manifold\u2019s user accessibility. Working closely with the great folks at the UW [Accessible Technology Services](https://www.washington.edu/accessibility/help/) (ATS), we tackled a [long list of barriers](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aaccessibility) that disabled users may have previously encountered while using Manifold. This was a coordinated effort that involved ATS auditing the frontend and backend of the application, Lael updating Manifold\u2019s design to meet WCAG AA visual requirements, and Cast Iron implementing fixes for many of the flagged issues. Thanks goes to Matt and Terence as well for coordinating the whole spirited effort. Embracing the diversity of our users\u2019 abilities is a critical part of developing for the Web. I\u2019m excited in 2020 to continue making Manifold an open platform for _all_.\\n\\n## Jojo\\n\\n For me, Manifold has brought great adventure this year: I\u2019ve visited 13 CUNY campuses to interview OER representatives in libraries and centers for teaching and learning. Yet the distances I\u2019ve gone via the MTA are nothing compared to the distances I\u2019ve seen project creation grow in the hands of motivated teachers. A 2019 Manifold highlight I won\u2019t forget was watching a colleague in my English program, Micheal Rumore, get his course reader together and up in a single evening. I spent a half hour training him and by the next morning, he\u2019d compiled his [English 302 course reader](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/projects/makingthemodern). I also got to visit Justin Rogers-Cooper\u2019s master\u2019s seminar to introduce their course edition of [Hubert Harrison\u2019s The Negro and the Nation](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/projects/hubert-harrison-the-negro-and-the-nation), which was also the first project I worked on with the brilliant Krysia Michael. It\u2019s always a joy watching someone get their first manifest validated. Most recently, I had the fortune to watch In\xe9s Va\xf1\xf3 Garc\xeda pull together her undergraduates\u2019 work on [The Spanish Speaking Community](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/projects/the-spanish-speaking-community). She went from no knowledge of markdown to completing a project full of embedded media elements in the course of a week. I\u2019m so impressed by how these busy teachers stepped out of their comfort zones, the greatest distance we ever travel, to benefit their classes. I can\'t wait to watch as more and more people teach with Manifold.\\n\\n## Krysia\\n\\nOne of the most wonderful parts of 2019 for me has been getting to work on Manifold and to help faculty at CUNY learn about the platform and develop teaching projects. I worked with more than 115 faculty and staff members across CUNY campuses and presented at the Association of Computers in the Humanities as well as the Digital Humanities Summer Institute in Victoria, Canada. I also got to accompany Terence on his Pilot visit to the University of Washington. I can\u2019t wait to see what 2020 has in store for Manifold!\\n\\n***\\n\\nThanks for following along!

Yet I think the takeaways from this visit will serve as a catalyst for much of our future work.\\n\\nJeff, having had an opportunity to explore the [CUNY instance](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/) before the ALG instance was up, was well primed to jump into the more advanced topics right off the bat. And straight away he and Terence were able to zero in on some spaces where the platform has opportunities to better provide for the online textbook experience. Of particular note is the notion of using authentication systems like [Open Athens](https://www.openathens.net/)\u2014in conjunction with our forthcoming access restrictions and entitlements systems\u2014as a means to credential folks straight away for specific projects. For instance, the system could recognize from the SAML handoff that a certain user has faculty standing and thus is automatically credentialed to see certain projects (e.g., quiz materials) that others would not be entitled to by default.\\n\\nWe also spoke of new possibilities for our ingestion strategies. Advanced Manifold users can do quite a bit with a text, but for those working in Word and Google Doc there are more limitations. Yet that\u2019s where authors tend to dwell most. Being able to meet them in that space and empower them to produce materials that don\u2019t require as much technical attention from the publisher before they are made live will be essential for OA publishers who don\u2019t have large support staff dedicated to such tasks.\\n\\nAs always, Terence was delighted to work directly with librarians and experts in discovery systems. The team has recently been talking about link resolvers and now we can also be thinking through the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting 2.0 standard and the ways it can be mapped to the EBSCO Discovery Network as a means to better surface Manifold materials in places where those interested are looking.\\n\\nGiven all these great conversations, it\u2019s hard not to see this last chapter in the second pilot as a shining light and spark of fire for the next iterations of the Manifold platform.\\n\\n> Manifold will enable Affordable Learning Georgia to take our open textbooks into the future of digital reading. We\'re very excited about the accessibility and connectedness that Manifold brings to the world of OER!\\n>\\n> \u2014 Jeff Gallant\\n\\nFor more, visit [Affordable Learning Georgia\u2019s website](https://www.affordablelearninggeorgia.org/) and follow [Affordable Learning Georgia on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ALearningGA).\\n\\n- **Miles traveled:** 1,968\\n- **Food Featured:** Tuesday afternoon they made our way downtown for a leisurely and utterly delightful vegetarian lunch at [The Grit](https://www.thegrit.com/).

Beyond being able to share common challenges and triumphs, it\'s wonderful to catch up with one another outside the traditional meetings.\\" That said, they very much made the most of their time exploring Manifold to better understand its capabilities as well as its implications and opportunities to affect press workflow and responsibilities.\\n\\nMick Gusinde-Duffy had previously remarked:\\n\\n> On first look, Manifold offers an intuitive, publisher-friendly platform that will accelerate UGA Press\'s digital publishing program and enable broader intellectual impact.\\n\\nManifold was built to extend off of existing publisher workflows, to take materials they are already producing and provide a space where they can be enhanced and explored in meaningful ways. Yet Manifold also opens up new opportunities to reveal scholarship in earlier stages than university presses usually do. While Manifold is easy to use, such new potentials introduce new responsibilities. Terence and the UGA Press team considered\\n\\n- which determining factors of which projects lend themselves to Manifold editions;\\n- how to best engage with authors about expectations for those editions;\\n- how to make projects discoverable to libraries and readers; and\\n- who, how, and when to prepare those elements that won\'t be part of the print edition were prominent themes.\\n\\nEnhancing these conversations was Emily McGinn, who oversees the Willson Center Digital Humanities Lab, adjacent to the press offices. Emily will be playing a role in shaping and enabling the new content appearing on the UGA Press instance. Emily was fundamental to the conversation exploring the nitty gritty of the internal dynamics of how we produce Manifold editions at Minnesota and in what ways those can be adapted at Georgia. Terence commented, \\"For me, this was just exciting.

What Dr. Ross described was the work of empowerment, decolonization, and knowledge sharing. This was another instance of our hopes for the platform proving out.\\n\\nDuring our first day we explored Manifold primarily through the lens of it working in service to the journal. As our conversations developed through the afternoon and into the next day, it was becoming clear that Manifold could not only help Dr. Ross with the journal but also with other publishing initiatives she\'s been thinking through with her nascent editorial team: Ericka Dunbar and Ebony Johnson. Our earlier demos had shown off the system\'s primary functionalities, but there\'s so much lurking under the surface to take advantage that become clear the more you explore. That\'s when the ideas really start coming out: wait, wait, I can use this for this and this and this too! Manifold not only facilitates a means to enhance materials you\'re already producing it enables publishing materials in entirely new and meaningful ways.\\n\\n> Great morning with [@drreross](https://twitter.com/drreross) leading us in creating a prototype of the forthcoming Black Women and Religious Cultures journal on [@ManifoldScholar](https://twitter.com/ManifoldScholar).

Her passion, excitment, and joy for her work were not only tangible, they were utterly catching. Much of the press\'s focus is devoted to the recovery of primary documents and scholarship in both Spanish and English, from before the Mexican Revolution and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo through to the 1960s. These documents are uncovered and brought to light through intense research of archival materials by students and staff who use their findings to reach out to libraries and community members\u2014descendants of those who made these first-hand accounts\u2014to secure and scan them as a means to preserve, contextualize, and realize them as a living history of the Latino community, accounts which would otherwise be absent from the histories.

We\'ve also made notable strides in improving Manifold\'s accessibility and are now publishing docker images to Docker Hub.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Major Features\\n\\n### Reading Groups\\n\\nWith the arrival of v4.0, any user on a Manifold instance can [create a reading group to collaboratively annotate texts](https://manifoldapp.org/docs/reading/annotating#reading-groups). Reading groups can be private, public, or anonymous. Readers can join groups using a unique code or URL. From within the Manifold reader, group members can specify which reading groups an annotation belongs to. Annotations within groups can be filtered by author or text, and group moderators can manage group membership. &nbsp;Want to assign a reading to a class and provide a private environment for students to engage with one another? Have a first draft you want feedback on? Want to create a unique scholarly edition? Reading Groups are for you!\\n\\nWe have more plans around reading groups, and are currently looking at ways to expand this feature so that cohorts of readers can collect and curate non-textual content on a Manifold instance. Keep an eye on [Slack](https://manifold-slackin.herokuapp.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold) for more details!\\n\\n### Standalone Projects\\n\\nVersion 4.0 introduces two modes for viewing projects in Manifold: library mode and [standalone mode](https://manifoldapp.org/docs/projects/customizing/general#standalone). Library mode is the default view that Manifold users are accustomed to. The new standalone view strips away Manifold navigation from the project page, and presents a project as though it were a small microsite. We introduced this feature to better support groups who want to link out to individual projects from their existing websites instead of duplicating their catalog in the Manifold library.\\n\\n### Header Bar\\n\\nManifold 4.0 exposes settings that allow administrators to include a [persistent header](https://manifoldapp.org/docs/customizing/settings.html#instance-header) throughout the installation. This header can be used to link back to a press marketing site, for example, and it can be overridden for projects in standalone mode.\\n\\n### Accessibility Improvements\\n\\nThe Manifold development team has worked closely with the accessibility experts at the University of Washington to take ongoing steps toward improving Manifold\'s accessibility. Version 4.0 ships with significant accessibility improvements for many Manifold components in the frontend, backend, and reader. We\'re committed to making Manifold a pleasure to use for all readers and content creators, and will continue to improve accessibility in upcoming releases. Going forward, we will break out all accessibility improvements in our change log so they are easier to track!\\n\\nSpecial thanks to the University of Washington [Libraries](https://www.lib.washington.edu/) and [IT Accessible Technology Services](https://www.washington.edu/accessibility/) for the ongoing and generous sharing of wisdom and good humor. We are thrilled and truly appreciative of all your time and support.\\n\\n### Docker Support\\n\\nStarting with v4.0, we are publishing docker images to Docker Hub. Users have been asking for Docker images for some time now, and we\'re glad we\'re now able to meet this need. We\'ll be adding docker documentation in the next couple days. In the meantime, visit our [ManifoldScholar/manifold-docker-compose](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold-docker-compose) repository to get started.\\n\\n## Minor Features\\n\\n- Backend users can download the ingestion source file for a text, if present.\\n- Added JSON-LD metadata for projects\\n- Manifold used to render icons from an icon font. These have all been replaced with SVGs\\n- Added a \\"finished\\" flag to projects to prevent updated date from appearing in project lists\\n- Numerous design improvements to reader user interfaces\\n- Relax user style sheet validation and allow more user styles on texts\\n- Many small improvements to text ingestion\\n- Additional font sizes and margins added to reader options\\n\\n## Bug Fixes\\n\\nRoughly fifty bugs have been fixed for the v4.0 release. The full list of bug fixes is included in our [change log](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nWe\'re going to dive right into Manifold v5.0. The focus of v5.0 will be preservation. We\'ll be creating a mechanism to save a manifold project to a static file format that can be deposited into an institutional repository like Portico. As part of this work, we will improve and document Manifold\'s existing CLI interface with the aim of making programatic text ingestion and project creation possible.\\n\\nWhile we had hoped to release API documentation as part of v4.0, it looks like we need a few more weeks to wrap it up. Progress is well underway, and we expect to publish the first iteration of Manifold\'s API documentation in mid-October."},{"id":"manifolddigitalservicesspotlightmeshatmichiganstateuniversity","metadata":{"permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/manifolddigitalservicesspotlightmeshatmichiganstateuniversity","source":"@site/blog/2019-09-20-manifold-digital-services-spotlight-mesh-at-michigan-state-university.md","title":"Manifold Digital Services Spotlight: MESH at Michigan State University","description":"This week we find our trusty digital projects editor on the road in East Lansing with Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Scott Schopieray, Kelly Sattler, and members of MESH at Michigan State University.","date":"2019-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.545,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"manifolddigitalservicesspotlightmeshatmichiganstateuniversity","title":"Manifold Digital Services Spotlight: MESH at Michigan State University","image":"/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/09/meshGopher-1.jpg","image_alt":"watercolor illustration of a Michigan State University Spartan helmet logo suspended in midair, facing a gopher holding the Manifold logo"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Manifold Version 4.0 Overview","permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/manifoldversion40overview"},"nextItem":{"title":"Manifold Digital Services Spotlight: Fembot Collective","permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/manifolddigitalservicesspotlightfembotcollective"}},"content":"This week we find our trusty digital projects editor on the road in East Lansing with Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Scott Schopieray, Kelly Sattler, and members of MESH at Michigan State University.\\n\\n> This is the life!

They talked about how best to present and structure journals on Manifold, mapped out a possible means to integrate a custom peer-review application they are crafting, and even ventured into crunchy topics of digital preservation, branding, data migration, and extensibility through Manifold APIs. Each concept served as a catalyst to further, more nuanced conversations specific to their work within their group and how and where it may intersect with the greater university community here in East Lansing.

The hallmark feature for this release is the addition of project content blocks, which provides editors the ability to customize the content that appears on project landing pages.\\n\\n## Major Features\\n\\n### Project Content Blocks\\n\\nWith version 3.0, editors can now pick which blocks of content\u2014texts, metadata, resources, markdown, metadata, activity\u2014they want to appear on project pages, and the order in which they should appear. These blocks are configurable on a per project basis and expand the range of project types that Manifold can easily support. When users create projects, they are offered a series of choices that will scaffold the project blocks based on their answers.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### Customizable Project Heroes\\n\\nThe project page hero area is now fully customizable. Editors can manage all the content in this area and add calls to action below the description or the cover image. These calls to action have been decoupled from the published text.\\n\\n### Alpha Plugin Interfaces\\n\\nVersion 3.0 includes an early stab at making Manifold more extensible and customizable. Documentation for these interfaces is forthcoming (in the next week or so), and the interface is still subject to change as we refine our thinking around this feature. For the time being, it is possible to add a custom Sass file that overrides global color variables. We\'ve also added interfaces for replacing the Manifold header and footer with a custom implementation, which will allow support for institutional branding. More on this to come in the coming weeks and in what will likely be a 3.1 release.\\n\\n### Responsive Reader iFrames and H5P Embeds\\n\\nThe Manifold reader now does a better job of sizing iFrames responsively, and also allows users to add custom data attributes to the ingestion source to embed H5P interactive content. This integration is a first step toward including more dynamic elements in the reader, and we\'re looking forward to building on it in the future.\\n\\n### Improvements to Search\\n\\nPrior to version 3.0, every text node in a text being ingested into the Manifold reader was broken out into a separate model in the database to simplify the Elasticsearch indexing process. This was not a scalable or performant approach. We\'ve removed this intermediary model and improved how texts are indexed, which speeds up the indexing process significantly. Full-text search results have been redesigned so it\'s now possible to see full-text hits in the context of the section the hit appears in. Annotations have been added to global search results.\\n\\n### Redesigned Backend Lists\\n\\nWe\'ve redesigned backend interfaces for listing records, which includes lists of projects, events, makers, users, features, and pages. We\'ve improved the mobile responsiveness of these interfaces and refined the overall look and feel. List filtering logic has been refactored and simplified. New filters have been added to project lists for listing only projects you\'ve created.\\n\\n### Project Collections\\n\\nWe released project collections in an intermediary release\u2014version 2.1\u2014between 2.0 and 3.0. Project collections give publishers a way to group projects and highlight those groups on the Manifold home page. We\'ve continued to make small improvements to this feature as we\'ve worked toward 3.0 and learned more about how it\'s being used.\\n\\n## Minor Features\\n\\nIn addition to the features outlined above, Manifold 3.0 ships with the following minor features:\\n\\n- Thumbnails are now generated for PDF resources.\\n- We removed IP addresses, names, and email address from Rails logs as a step toward GDPR compliance.\\n- The reader\'s dark mode has been improved.\\n- When creating video resources, users can post a Vimeo or YouTube URL, and Manifold will sort out the video ID.\\n- Admin users can now unsubscribe a user from all Manifold notifications.\\n- The ingestion user interface design has been improved and simplified.\\n- A new metadata field\u2014original publication date\u2014has been added to text records.\\n- Rails has been upgrades from 5.0 to 5.1.\\n- A project can now have multiple published texts whereas before it could only have one.\\n- Image credits can be added to the project hero.\\n- The order of texts and text stylesheets is now managed through a drag and drop interface.\\n- Editors can now configure the start and stop date for showing a project collection on the Manifold home page, as well as how many projects appear in that collection.\\n- Some date inputs have been replaced with a date picker.\\n- Text stylesheets can be assigned to specific text sections.\\n- A favicon can be specified for a Manifold instance.\\n- Annotations can be flagged as inappropriate.\\n- Project placeholder icon is now responsive and displays better at lower sizes.\\n- We\'ve updated the set of Manifold icons, making size and style more consistent across the application.\\n- Features can now be published/unpublished from the list rather than the individual feature detail view.\\n- We improved support for anchor links in manifest ingestion TOC.\\n\\n## Bug Fixes\\n\\nOver 75 bug fixes found their way into version 3.0!\\n\\n## Accessibility Improvements\\n\\nImproving Manifold\'s accessibility is an ongoing area of focus. We\'re thankful for the University of Washington\'s help in this regard, and look forward to continuing our partnership with them for future improvements and functionality.\\n\\n- Keyboard controls added to the project collection icon picker component\\n- Keyboard controls added for reordering content block lists and for navigating and moving action callouts\\n- Improved accessibility of backend project lists\\n- Refactored form toggle components to use more accessible label attributes\\n- Began improving ARIA labels on icons\\n- Added aria-describedby text to utility toggle, user menu buttons\\n- Added close language near x icon in drawers\\n- Improved keyboard controls of search inputs\\n- Removed nested skip-to links\\n- Adjusted header tags to be more semantic and accessible\\n- Improved markup accessibility on dashboard stats table"},{"id":"manifolddigitalservicespilotspotlightconcordiauniversitypress","metadata":{"permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/manifolddigitalservicespilotspotlightconcordiauniversitypress","source":"@site/blog/2019-04-02-manifold-digital-services-pilot-spotlight-concordia-university-press.md","title":"Manifold Digital Services Pilot Spotlight: Concordia University Press","description":"This is part 11 of the Travels with Terence series, following our digital projects editor on his pilot press in-person training program.","date":"2019-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":4.38,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"manifolddigitalservicespilotspotlightconcordiauniversitypress","title":"Manifold Digital Services Pilot Spotlight: Concordia University Press","image":"/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/03/29991CDB-6E40-4E6F-B710-971045701953.jpg","image_alt":"watercolor illustration of a bee and gopher by Jojo Karlin"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Manifold Version 3.0 Overview","permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/manifoldversion30overview"},"nextItem":{"title":"Manifold Digital Services Spotlight: University of Washington Press","permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/manifolddigitalservicesspotlightuniversityofwashingtonpress"}},"content":"This is part 11 of the Travels with Terence series, following our digital projects editor on his pilot press in-person training program.\\n\\nLast week Terence was in Montreal, Quebec, meeting with the three-person staff of [Concordia University Press](http://www.concordia.ca/press.html), which was established in 2016 and will this fall publish its first books.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\u201cIt\'s exciting for a new scholarly publisher like Concordia University Press to be a part of this pilot,\u201d noted interim director Geoffrey Little. \u201cWe look forward to learning how Manifold can help us publish our peer-reviewed open-access books.\u201d\\n\\nDespite priding himself as being directionally adept, Terence found himself a bit misplaced when he made his way to the Webster Library\u2014home of the press\u2014for the first sessions of the trip. \u201cI was a bit early, and as I was making my way around a woman who had walked past me just a moment prior called out my name. It was Meredith Carruthers, the press\u2019s Editorial and Production Coordinator; she recognized me from my email avatar. That was definitely a first, especially given how bad I am at making avatars of myself.\u201d\\n\\nAfter introductions and a brief tour, Terence led Meredith and the press\u2019s intern Charles on a guided tour of the platform, beginning with its origins and aims, demoing its present capabilities, and concluding with a review of the roadmap for future development. \u201cI always love doing this opening session because it really reveals what the system is and serves as a catalyst for so many of the discussions that come in the later sessions.\u201d\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/03/webster2.jpg\').default}\\n    alt=\\"\\"\\n  />\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/03/webster1.jpg\').default}\\n    alt=\\"\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption>What a fantastic space the Webster Library provided.

Terence remarked:\\n\\n> As a brand new press with a small staff, Concordia is in such an exciting space where they aren\u2019t beholden to past norms and can instead chart their course fresh from scratch. There\u2019s so much involved in building up a publishing house, but it\u2019s also so very invigorating to be at the start of something. We bonded a bit over that a bit. With Manifold only its fourth year, we can very much relate.\\n\\nThe next day Terence ran a session demoing the platform for interested parties from throughout the university, especially from within the library, as well as from the local publishing community, including Jonathan Crago from McGill-Queen\u2019s University Press. After a quick break the team was back at it with lead developer, Zach Davis, leading a session about the underlying architecture of Manifold remotely from Cast Iron\u2019s offices in Portland, Oregon.\\n\\nTerence and the Concordia group came away with a strong basis for considering their own forward steps. \\"We covered a lot of great ground in that meeting, and we were able to really hash through some interesting questions of how to represent material arts, which will be a focus of the press\u2019s work, in a digital landscape like Manifold. I feel like we walked away from that meeting with a host of ideas for possible new features that would speak to those concerns.\\"\\n\\nAs a sort of punctuation mark to that meeting, Meredith and Terence took a long lunch at the nearby [Canadian Centre for Architecture](https://www.cca.qc.ca/en/) to attend a talk by architect Konstantinos Pantazis, co-founder of [Point Supreme Architects](http://www.pointsupreme.com/content/) based in Athens. Konstantinos\'s presentation was an informal reflection on ten influential books in his career and process. Terence commented:\\n\\n> Being in that beautiful museum and listening to a nuanced conversation about the artistry of physical and functional objects was all the more striking having been talking about a platform that exists in an ethereal space. It was a striking counterpoint to the day. It certainly helped recenter us for the final session, a three-hour-long deep dive into the use Manifold. And then all of a sudden we were done. And the first round of pilot visits were over.

Due to Washington\u2019s interest in Manifold as a tool for Open Educational Resources (OER), and more generally for classroom use, Terence was joined by Krystyna Michael, Open Educational Technologist at the Graduate Center, CUNY.\\n\\nThe University of Washington team, spearheaded by Beth Fuget at the press and Elliott Stevens, Verletta Kern, and Liz Bedford from the library side, welcomed Terence and Krystyna for a few days of meetings. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nAfter landing on Monday, Terence and Krystyna had a whirlwind tour of the press (with homemade scones) where they ran a quick demo of Manifold for Press Director Nicole Mitchell and the bulk of the editorial team. They then made for the library where they introduced Manifold\u2019s main features before discussing how to structure projects, curate content, map project development, and work with authors from teaching and publishing perspectives. They finished (amid cookies) with a close review of the development roadmap, an exploration of how other institutions are using Manifold, and how Manifold is situated against other players in the community.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/03/uwtower.jpg\').default}\\n    alt=\\"\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption>Looking out over the city and campus, with Mount Rainier in the background, from UW Tower.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nA theme that emerged from those discussions is how, rather than a centralized system that dictates its use, Manifold is a flexible tool that individual institutions can\u2014and are expected to\u2014make their own. At the same time, Manifold fosters a community for the institutions and individuals who use it to rely upon and with whom to explore questions collaboratively.\\n\\nTuesday opened with a refresher introduction for those unable to attend Monday, before progressing into sessions focusing on how Manifold is already being used in the classroom, both at CUNY and Washington. Terence noted that \u201cthose sessions were the highlight of the trip for me. It was utterly invaluable to have Krystyna there in person leading those discussions and talking about her experiences using Manifold as a pedagogical tool and speaking to the privacy and legal questions and constructs that come up around such use. And to then have an instructor from Washington come up with his students and share their experiences using the platform to enable their scholarship\u2014it was really powerful and inspiring. I felt it, and I\u2019m certain Matt did too,\u201d referring to Matt Gold, Manifold\u2019s co-PI who remoted in from New York to speak alongside Krystyna.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/03/allen.jpg\').default}\\n    alt=\\"\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption>A view of the beautiful Suzzallo Library at the heart of campus.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t already a big day, Terence and Krystyna finished off with a three-plus-hour tour of how to push Manifold to its limits without cracking open the command line interface (CLI). \u201cWe left any talk of the CLI to Zach on Wednesday,\u201d Terence said, speaking of Manifold\u2019s lead developer, Zach Davis, who led a remote session from Cast Iron Coding\u2019s Portland offices on Wednesday, digging deep into the underlying structure and architecture of the system while also tackling important questions about accessibility. Ahead of these training sessions, Washington\u2019s Accessibility Office did a thorough review of Manifold and provided nuanced notes to help expand on the work Zach\u2019s team had done in this area last summer. Enabling Manifold to be as accessible as possible is a core tenet of Manifold\u2019s ongoing development plans, so it was quite the coup to receive expert advice from Washington\u2019s office, which regularly works with clients like Microsoft and Google.\\n\\nClosing out the trip, Terence commented,\\n\\n> I\u2019m so glad Washington is a part of the Manifold community. Their passion and enthusiasm are so striking, and I can\u2019t thank Beth, Elliott, Verletta, and Liz enough for arranging such an amazing schedule, including impromptu tours of the beautiful campus, delicious Mexican food, and of course fish and chips.\\n\\nFollow the University of Washington Press on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UniversityofWashingtonPress/), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/UWAPress/), or [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/UWashingtonPress), and University of Washington Libraries on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/uwlibraries) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uwlibraries).\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/03/Washington_W@4x.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n- **Miles Travelled:** 2,780\\n- **New offshoot series:** Trekking with Krystyna\\n- **Dining Notes:** More fish and chips!!! &nbsp; Thanks for reading!

With their emphasis on archives and an intersectional feminist approach, Reanimate takes advantage of features in new and exciting ways.\\n\\nTerence remarked:\\n\\n> Process was a huge part of our conversation. We started with the ways Manifold can extend a publisher\u2019s existing workflows, dissecting how we use Manifold at Minnesota. Then Roopsi and I exploded that out and started thinking through different ways to approach Reanimate\u2019s initial projects, mentally sketching out a process that would be appropriate for collaborative DH publications rooted in archival materials. Doing so lead us along other related paths, from conceptualizing where and how a DH project can be oriented alongside Manifold to the ways in which the Manifold reader could support more dynamic elements. When [Matt](https://twitter.com/mkgold) and [Krysia](https://twitter.com/KrysiaSays) joined us remotely from New York, the conversation continued through an OER lens, charting how Manifold is being used in the classroom right now at CUNY and how instructors are organizing their materials in different ways to meet the needs of their students. It was really great to have Justin Snow, a member of the Reanimate collective and the Digital Initiatives Librarian from Salem State, join us on Thursday and Friday for those conversations. Unfortunately Carol was not able to attend in person this week, so I\u2019m keen to get some remote sessions scheduled to get her perspective before we connect later this summer at the [ACH conference](http://ach2019.ach.org/) in Pittsburgh.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/03/salem-sound.jpg\').default}\\n    alt=\\"two sailboat masts framing a blue sky with scattered clouds\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption>The Salem Sound in all its vibrant, wintry glory.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n- **Miles Travelled**: 2,260\\n- **Desserts to die for**: Nutella Cr\xe8me br\xfbl\xe9e at the Hawthorne Hotel and Flourless Chocolate cake with caramel and ice cream at Finz.

Every interaction wasn\'t just well mannered, it was earnestly friendly and engaging. Mr. McKenzie, who picked me up from the airport, was a fast friend. Moments after we met we were joking and laughing as if we were old friends reconnecting. And as we drove through the city he was often being hailed by others on the street or in traffic with quick hellos and well wishes. \\n>\\n> That first interaction underscored the dominant theme that emerged from the two days of training at UWI: building relationships and community. As we worked through the different discussion sections, our conversations blossomed from questions rooted in ways to supply the community at large with a rich host of local materials \u2014from dissertations and lecture series, to events around book launches that draw celebrated figures from the area, to focused events oriented around faculty, like the university\'s [Research Days](https://www.mona.uwi.edu/researchdays/), which were just starting up as I was leaving.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/02/aqueduct.jpg\').default}\\n    alt=\\"\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption>Remnants of the old cut-stone aqueduct that irrigated crops used in the production of rum. The UWI campus is located on sacred grounds, the site of a colonial slave plantation.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n> Beyond Manifold, as Joseph and Nadine graciously toured me through campus, community remained at the heart of our conversations. We talked about how important the [AUP community](http://www.aupresses.org/) is to scholarly publishing and as a resource to share knowledge and expertise among its members. We sat with department heads at the outdoor faculty club, where world-renowned experts from different fields can share a drink and exchange ideas in a relaxed environment. And as we made our way around, whether at the bookstore or the library, we saw how integral the press is to the university, with its books, its catalogs, notices of its events always on display. Just fantastic.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/02/cotton-tree.jpg\').default}\\n    alt=\\"tall tree with sun streaming through\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption>A silk-cotton tree on campus. It\'s a tree oft cited in myth and legend. With is exposed roots and towering stature, it\'s easy to see why.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n> And absolutely energizing, because I feel like what we are doing with Manifold is very much in keeping with this spirit. We\'ve created a platform that anyone can start using today, and we have a growing and vested community already exchanging ideas and setting up events and workshops around how best to leverage it in new and important ways. On the first day of training, not long after we began, Donna commented that at first it was a little difficult to parse my American accent, but that the younger generation of Jamaicans sounded just like me, that YouTube was working as a colonizing agent of language. Part of the reason we created Manifold was to help counteract that, decolonize publishing, and empower local communities to make it their own.\\n\\n- **Miles traveled:** 4,174\\n- **Banana bread breaks:** 2\\n- **Traffic Notes:** If you\'ve never been and are considering renting a car, don\'t.

Between sessions there was always a lot of talk among the various groups in the room, thinking about all the different projects they could bring to Manifold and the ways it could help enrich them. You could really feel the energy and excitement, and it was so great to have such a wide swath of the Emory community together in one space. In addition to those from the Fox Center and ECDS, we had a great turnout from folks from the [Scholarly Communications Office](https://sco.library.emory.edu/) and the [Center for Faculty Development and Excellence](http://www.cfde.emory.edu/).

Cast Iron lives in the former Washington High School, now called Revolution Hall, and the open floor plan is friendly and pin-drop quiet.

First we dug into development progress and plans for the roadmap. With Version 2.1 out just before Thanksgiving, things are on track. We chugged through and then reviewed the features to determine which were in line with the milestones written into the grant and which were in keeping with the project but beyond the reach of our funding.\\n\\nGiven the speed with which Zach and Max have been responding to issues raised in the press pilots on top of a continued grueling pace of new feature creation, we needed to reassess and allocate development hours.\\n\\nTo this end, Zach has reconfigured the [Roadmap](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/projects/7) to reflect the agreed upon refinements. In addition to changing language on existing milestones, he has broken up the different versions into distinct GitHub projects for easier tracking of related issues. When you look at an issue, such as \u201c[#1209](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/projects/11#card-15564015) [Implement lightweight content management for project pages,](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/1209)\u201d you\u2019ll see a \u201cprojects\u201d entry in the right column. That will tell you when we think we\u2019ll address that issue. Some short term changes had to be made for the sake of a more sustainable code base.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/12/IMG_7388-e1545079499869.jpg\').default}\\n    alt=\\"Doug in a school hallway with lockers under Cast Iron Coding sign\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption>Doug takes a locker break</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nWith all the great feedback on the Thanksgiving release of [Project Collections](http://blog.manifoldapp.org/2018/10/10/introducing-project-collections/), the team is on track with version 3.0 and the addition of Project Blocks, which promise even greater project level flexibility. Different projects will soon be able to display different components, so that resource-only projects will look different from iterative projects will look different from simpler manuscript-centered projects. Version 4.0 will allow publishers to better take advantage of Manifold through their existing websites by way of a build out for single projects as well as enjoy closed annotation groups for classroom or peer-review purposes.  \\n\\nOnce we made it through the roadmap and combed through the existing feature requests, we had lunch to repower before our discussion of analytics. Susan had prepared notes regarding open-access analytics needs, incorporating feedback from press partners. We discussed what Manifold analytics would be apart from Google Analytics. We thought about what sort of interface would be most useful for our users and whether building a means of porting in Google Analytics warranted the short term development expense and long term maintenance cost of such increased complexity. Decisions are always made with both user experience and platform sustainability in mind.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/12/IMG_7396.jpg\').default}\\n    alt=\\"golden retriever\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption>Ida</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nAfter a break to walk Ida the dog, we recommenced with our Open Educational Resource (OER) conversation. OERs are a growing use for Manifold. The [CUNY Manifold instance](http://cuny.manifoldapp.org) is expanding and educators and staff are finding new and exciting ways to share their work. Much of the discussion centered on how teachers might best organize course materials on Manifold. Project collections were developed for publishers, but offer a mechanism for arranging titles. As the development team moves forward, they are careful about creating not just easy but sustainable and appropriate solutions. We determined that a user page may be the best level for those sorts of controls, but developing that interface will take careful consideration.\\n\\nAs the day wore on, we dove deeper into discussions of project sustainability. With half the first set of pilot presses trained and the next set coming up quickly, we know we need to plan for the future. How do we maintain the growing energy behind this project and continue to support and develop Manifold beyond our current grant funding?\\n\\nSuch heavy ruminations led to bold brainstorming and we worked up our appetites. We made our way happily down to [Taqueria Nueve](http://www.taquerianueve.com/). Over tasty tacos, we discussed the merits of [Howard the Duck](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091225/), the relative (un)quotability of [Willow](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096446/), and the possibility of a trip down to [Ground Kontrol](https://groundkontrol.com/) (which proved overoptimistic). Tired but happy for each other\u2019s company, we called it a night.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/12/IMG_7428.jpg\').default}\\n    alt=\\"\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption>Lucas, Rowan, and Max working out the week at Cast Iron</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nFriday came fast, and we plunged ourselves into discussion of preservation. With a clearer sense of what a typical project contains and what should be provided to Portico, we worked on our plan for what Manifold could or should export. Terence gave updates on all the Manifold Digital Services Pilots\u2014all is going well. Having visited with Athabasca, Indiana, and coming directly from Temple, Terence has had a chance to see how Manifold can help in different ways.

Manifold is intentionally designed to enable scholars and publishers the means to both embrace and comfortably extend beyond traditional modes while still remaining familiar, intuitive, and scalable. Manifold is more than just a pretty platform\u2014it\u2019s a means to add value to scholarly publications of all kinds.Our conversations at Temple, as they did at Indiana and Athabasca prior, quickly moved from the process and mechanics of how to do things in Manifold to how Manifold can be used to do so much more than we\u2019re used to. It was a thrill to have Mary Rose creating new projects on their instance and talking strategy with Annie on one half of the table, while I was fielding questions from other team members about editorial and marketing process and expectations. It\u2019s a kick to be able to really talk shop in a collaborative and explorative way.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/12/temple-library.jpg\').default}\\n    alt=\\"View of modern library with trees and construction barriers in foreground\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption>The new library at Temple, now under construction and scheduled to open next summer, will also house the press, which presently resides off campus.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/12/20181204_140518.jpg\').default}\\n    alt=\\"Group photo of Mary Rose Muccie, Terence Smyre, and Annie Johnson holding Manifold mugs, smiling\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption>Mary Rose Muccie, Terence Smyre, and Annie Johnson, sporting some nifty Manifold diner mugs.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nExploring new possibilities is exhilarating and thirsty work.

The Manifold platform will provide IUP with a unique content vehicle for born-digital scholarship, allowing content in the platform to remain evergreen, while providing media-rich experiences for readers across the spectrum of devices. We are committed to opening up content to authors and those accessing their work in radically transformative ways. We believe Manifold will help us remain in the vanguard of engineering scholarly content by expanding options for our authors who are both excited to enhance the ways in which their research is shared and their stories are told.\u201d\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-14-at-2.49.32-PM.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"Tweet from IU Presss Michael Regoli welcoming Terence Smyre and Manifold to the Herman B Wells Library with a photo of participants watching a presentation\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nBeyond having the opportunity to work hand-in-hand with press staff for two days, Michael provided Terence a platform on which to speak to the broader university community, from those in the library, IT, and English departments, as well as other stakeholders and interested parties, about Manifold\'s origins, capabilities, and development roadmap. In our webcall following his return, Terence noted how important and exciting that was.\\n\\n> \u201cIt was great to be able to engage directly with those on campus who may have heard about the work we\'re doing but hadn\'t actually yet seen what Manifold can do, both for the press but also for the campus more generally.

It\u2019s also possible to create[project collections](https://marvelapp.com/9aeggi1/screen/46424311) that don\u2019t show up on the homepage but do have their own URL. You can create [many collections](https://marvelapp.com/9aeggi1/screen/46424307). Through _smart grouping_ and _manual groupings_, you have control over project displays.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-10-at-12.24.50-PM.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"Display of Manifold homepage with landing block plus first collection block\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n## Smart Groupings\\n\\nSmart groupings are organized semi-automatically. Publishers can select which content displays based on certain criteria and queries. Manifold will populate the home page with all the projects that fit the grouping parameters. The user builds the grouping and can edit them as the needs of a collection change. Projects cannot be added or removed from smart groupings manually, but tags and subject classifications can be used for granular selection of projects. New and edited projects are automatically added to groupings when they match the criteria. Projects will also be removed from the grouping if their metadata is modified and they no longer match the criteria. Because a smart project list can change automatically, the grouping can only be sorted by criteria (most recently updated, alphabetical, etc.) and not manually.\\n\\n### Features:\\n\\n- user-defined groups for projects on Manifold homepage\\n- user-defined groups that don\u2019t show up on the homepage (but do have stable URLs) ([see design](https://marvelapp.com/9aeggi1/screen/46424311))\\n- editable grouping criteria (tags and subject classifications)\\n- automatic integration of user\u2019s amendments to grouping criteria\\n- automatic removal of projects that no longer match grouping criteria\\n\\n## Manual Groupings\\n\\nFor publishers who want even more control than smart groupings allow, Manifold also has new manual grouping settings. With manual groupings, publishers select each project that gets displayed. A user can search and select individual projects to display. The hand-selected projects may be sorted manually with drag and drop or automatically by most recently updated, alphabetical, etc.\\n\\n### Features:\\n\\n- manual project selection for increased customization\\n- project adjustment by backend user\\n- drag and drop sorting\\n- automatic ordering of manually selected projects by most recently updated and alphabetical order\\n\\nWith these new controls in Manifold\u2019s backend interface, publishers can align the titles on the front page into their overall marketing efforts using manual and semi-automated mechanisms, bringing these projects and their Manifold site into the routine workflows of their marketing departments. Now you can highlight a book series. You can present an OER-focused Manifold site, using project collections to group texts by course, period, or genre. If you\u2019re a book publisher, you can use collections to highlight new releases or books related to a certain event, topic, conference.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-10-at-12.25.49-PM.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"Screenshot showing several stacked collections\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nWe\u2019ve also added a new [\u201cAll Projects\u201d view](https://marvelapp.com/9aeggi1/screen/46424346) to the frontend that lets users list all projects and filter and sort the projects.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-10-at-12.31.59-PM.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nFrom the bottom of any collection, you can always return to the All Projects view.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-10-at-12.26.12-PM.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nIn addition to the Project Collections feature, Cast Iron has been busily addressing bugs in version 2.0 and adding other features.

That\u2019s a lot of titles to say that he\u2019s about to work with the ten publishers ([announced this summer](http://blog.manifoldapp.org/2018/08/30/ten-publishers-to-begin-using-manifold/)) just starting off with Manifold. Terence came to Manifold and Minnesota after many years and many roles at the University of Nebraska Press, and he is ready to help integrate Manifold production into each publisher\u2019s workflow.\\n\\nTo kick off his exciting adventures, we thought we\u2019d feature an interview to give those following an idea of what he sees coming, how in-person trainings fit within digital domains, and which American Ninja Warrior challenges he anticipates. Terence has famously claimed to love airports\u2014we will see if that\u2019s still true when he returns from the ten training trips.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n**First question: Because you\u2019re someone who\u2019s worked a lot building projects on Manifold, to get our interview started could you tell readers\u2014what\u2019s your favorite thing about Manifold?**\\n\\nI like that we\u2019re providing a platform for people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have one or would have to rely on a separate vendor. Zach and his team at Cast Iron have done a lot of work to make sure that Manifold is easy to use, and I think that\u2019s crucial. I\u2019m a big fan of bringing as much work in-house as you can and building up your own experience and knowledge base.&nbsp;With Manifold, publishers will have the ability to serve their materials on the web in an elegant way and make use of all the various forms of media the digital environment allows.\\n\\n**I\u2019m curious about your experience before Manifold? Can you tell us something about your time at Nebraska?**\\n\\nI was at Nebraska for twelve-ish years, and I was in both the books and journals programs, but I primarily oversaw journals production. That involved working with journal editors and authors, evaluating manuscripts for structure, style, mechanics, and copyright concerns, coding manuscripts to our production system, preparing notes and directions for our freelance copy editors and our in-house typesetter, evaluating edits and proofs and corrections to them, and then working out print runs, etc. And I did some general business/budgetary stuff for those parts of the process I worked with. It was a lot, but it was a great team. I oversaw a typesetter dedicated to journals work and a project supervisor who I was glad to see take over for me when I left.\\n\\n**So full cycle?**\\n\\nFull cycle. I think when I was there we had thirty journals. Also, just before I left, we began working with Nebraska\u2019s extension program and helping them with their publications. The extension publications are a really good use case for Manifold\u2014often shorter documents, reports, created by experts in the field with outreach programs, all the way up to larger spiral bound publications.\\n\\n**Your text-preparation experience at Nebraska was pretty soup to nuts?**\\n\\nYeah. It was fun. I was also part of a small team that helped implement Scribe\u2019s Well-Formed Document Workflow for the press, changing over from a do-it-yourself coding system to a more regimented, structured XML workflow.\\n\\n**So you were ready. You knew Manifold was the thing we needed.**\\n\\nIt\u2019s funny, I remember in April 2015 when the press release went out about Manifold, I thought \u201cthis is what we should be doing\u2014we should be doing _this_\u201d and that if any position opened up, I was going to throw my hat in. Because there\u2019s no way I couldn\u2019t. When I saw the advertisement later that summer I was excited, but I also didn\u2019t expect to get a call, because I was sure everyone and their brother would be banging down the door for the opportunity. It\u2019s just too awesome.\\n\\n**It\u2019s worked out great for all of us.**\\n\\nI feel very lucky. This is a dream job. I mean, where else do you get to work on such an important and far-reaching project with a team of just absolutely awesome people. We\u2019ve built this amazing platform in just a few years, and we still are able to cover important questions like _Beastmaster_ or _Krull_ on Slack. It doesn\u2019t get any better than that.\\n\\n**Now that you\u2019re starting to work with presses of different sizes, how do you adapt to different workflows?**\\n\\nThe big thing I\u2019ve noticed is that getting to EPUB is not always an easy reach for some publishers. They can get to it, but it\u2019s roundabout\u2014exporting from InDesign or Google Docs\u2014and they don\u2019t have that same fundamental control over them or the experience of breaking into the EPUB and doing the fine tuning.\\n\\nFor most university presses, that\u2019s not going to be an issue\u2014they\u2019ll do it in house with Scribe or P-Shift or they\u2019ll outsource it to a vendor who can do it for them. In those cases, you\u2019re going to get something that works just fine. We\u2019ve tested EPUB files from a host of different vendors, and we\u2019ve never had any problem\u2014they all work in Manifold.\\n\\nFor smaller or newer publishers, getting to that point is not always as easy, which is why it\u2019s so nice to have support for Word and Google Doc ingestion. Likewise for those willing to branch out to Markdown and HTML. Markdown, I think, is an easy reach, and if you\u2019re open to that, that\u2019s great. I\u2019m all about the Markdown.\\n\\n**Me, too!**\\n\\nReally? Are you trying it?\\n\\n**Yeah--I am working on a book for a friend because she teaches books that are out of copyright. Her class chose an early American novel, *Hope Leslie*, that has no EPUB but exists on the Internet Archive as a PDF and in OCRed plaintext. It\u2019s super messy and I\u2019m teaching myself how to structure it in Markdown. The plan is to get it up on CUNY Manifold so she can teach with it. If I trusted my ability to program, I\u2019d run some scripts, but I\u2019m mostly cleaning by hand.**\\n\\nSo you\u2019re just taking the dirty OCR and running some scripts on it and making it look good?\\n\\n**More like I am running find and replace.**\\n\\nI\u2019ve done that a lot of times\u2014and even just doing that, I\u2019ve found, is a big step up and often very useful for those around you. Most of the \u201cscripts\u201d I\u2019ve written are simply just chains of find and replace.\\n\\n**Which leads me to the question about smaller presses--for the presses that don\u2019t have EPUB production built into their system, how much do you anticipate in terms of teaching?**\\n\\nIt\u2019ll be a lot of prep work and dialoguing. Talking to all the pilot programs before I go out for my in-person training to see what their workflows look like and getting some sample files. I\u2019m looking to craft a roadmap and a process that a publisher can easily use and replicate as a sort of touchstone that they can later spring from into more complex or creative uses of the platform. And hopefully during the training, we can work through the bulk of the big questions in person. After that I expect there will still be a host of fringe questions that we can take care of in a venue like this [a web call] or in our&nbsp;[Slack channel](https://manifold-slackin.herokuapp.com/). It\u2019s really cool to have the #Pilot channel on Slack so that people who have similar sorts of approaches or levels of experience are able to interact directly with one another and get good practical feedback.\\n\\n**Very cool! We advocate conversation and community.**\\n\\nThat\u2019s the way you learn! It\u2019s nice to be put in touch with others grappling with similar issues and to dynamically engage with those questions. A lot of times you don\u2019t know who to talk to or reach out to, and to have that built into the fabric of our program is really cool.\\n\\n**Can you give a list of technical skills or aptitudes that you think would be important for a Manifold editor at a press?**\\n\\nZach and his team have made it _amazingly_ easy to get stuff into the system and looking beautiful. So the first response that bubbles up for me is to say something like, I don\u2019t think you need a bunch of technical know-how . . .\\n\\n**I\u2019ve told people that it can help to have some familiarity_ _with Markdown, a basic text editor, maybe Wordpress or some HTML.**\\n\\nYeah, that\u2019s a more useful answer. I\u2019d say CSS as well. If you\u2019ve even done some cursory work with CSS or HTML, you\u2019re going to be just fine.\\n\\nAnd really, all the heavy lifting will be in file prep. If for whatever reason you\u2019re working with file types that Manifold can\u2019t ingest natively, then it\u2019s going to be about being willing to stretch yourself and not being afraid of technology. Nothing that anybody does is going to break anything. If you encounter problems, we\u2019re going to be there to help. The big thing is not to be afraid, embrace the different tools that are available, cultivate a pioneering spirit, and just experiment. You don\u2019t have to know exactly what you\u2019re doing, but if you\u2019re willing to throw yourself out there, then you\u2019re going to be just fine. And more than likely you\u2019re going to find it\u2019s a lot easier than you expect. You might hit a few initial road bumps, but once you\u2019ve cleared them you\u2019ll see this is a lot different or easier and not as cumbersome as you imagined it to be. Especially with Manifold.\\n\\n**It helps to have some understanding of where different operations take place.**\\n\\nOh definitely. And that guides us as we are creating documentation. It\u2019s really important to understand how things are working and how you can affect what you\u2019re seeing on screen. In a conference call recently I had a question about linked footnotes, and the person on the call asked if Manifold was automating that process, automatically creating a link between the text and the note. (Manifold isn\u2019t doing that; it\u2019s simply honoring the source document\u2019s links.) That\u2019s not clear when you\u2019re just coming to this. So we are working really hard to make sure that those kinds of questions have good answers in our documentation. That if you aren\u2019t sure how something works or how to change what you\u2019re seeing, there\u2019s an answer with clear steps you can take to get the results you want.\\n\\n**So having some basic skills helps, but truly if you can create a document on a computer, you can create a Manifold project?**\\n\\nYeah. If you can navigate a web page and use a browser, working in Manifold isn\u2019t harder than that.\\n\\n**What do you anticipate with the presses to come? Do you have particular things you\u2019re looking out for?**\\n\\nI\u2019m sure there will be lots of obstacles, but I\u2019ll be doing my homework ahead of time so I can be as prepared as possible when I\u2019m out there. I\u2019m versed in Mac and PC systems, but it\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve used a PC\u2014Nebraska was PC-based and I know a lot of university presses are\u2014so I\u2019m going to dust off my old desktop beforehand to make sure I\u2019m fluent again with those systems. But then in terms of production, it\u2019s going to be interesting to see where they\u2019re leaving off Word, if they\u2019re leaving off Word and getting to other document types. Because almost everyone we talked to can get to PDF, but as you know Manifold doesn\u2019t do PDF in the reader. So what is the step before? And then exploring what they\u2019re doing and how to get from there into Manifold. That\u2019ll be interesting, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be difficult. I think it\u2019ll be more about navigating the procedural nuances for the different houses.\\n\\n**Do you have a sense of how many people will be in your training sessions?**\\n\\nI\u2019ll know beforehand. The first press, Athabasca, is around eight people, I believe. Usually it\u2019ll be pretty production-oriented, but some will be coming from editorial and some will just be from different backgrounds who have the bandwidth and the gusto. When I go out, I\u2019ll be doing a general overview for everyone so they have an idea of \u201cwhat is this thing we signed up for?\u201d, getting an appreciation for what Manifold can do for them and having the opportunity to ask questions, before breaking off into smaller focus groups. It tends to work best when you have eight to ten people crowding around a computer and a couple monitors\u2014you can really get into the nitty gritty and get some good work accomplished that way.\\n\\n**Do the presses have collections they have pinpointed?**\\n\\nMost of them yes. Some have works coming down the pipe.\\n\\n**Have you ever been to any of the presses before?**\\n\\nNot a one!\\n\\n**Have you been to any of the cities?**\\n\\nI\u2019ve been to Atlanta before. I\u2019ve never been to Canada . . .\\n\\n**You\u2019ve never been to Canada? Who are you?**\\n\\nThe guy who\u2019s never been to Canada. I\u2019ve never been to the UK, and I\u2019ve never been to Jamaica. I\u2019ve not been to Temple.\\n\\n**Have you been to Philadelphia?**\\n\\nYes. And I\u2019ve run up the steps. And yes. I\u2019ll be running up the steps again. I\u2019ve been to Seattle, but not to the press.I\u2019ve never been to Bloomington, Indiana, or Cincinnati. The only things I know about Cincinnati I learned from _WKRP in Cincinnati_\u2014so not much.\\n\\n**What will you read on the plane?**\\n\\nI don\u2019t know! I\u2019m just finishing _Don\u2019t Look Behind You_ by Samuel Rogers. I\u2019ve got a few books on the nightstand that will make good travel fare. I\u2019ve never read the Harry Potter books._Ever?_Ever. I read the first one not that long ago. It was really good! I have the second one just waiting for me.(_At this point I recommended the_ [_Witch, Please_](http://ohwitchplease.ca/) _podcast._)That sounds cool. I don\u2019t know what else I\u2019m going to queue up. Do you know of the Flavia De Luce books?\\n\\n**I know of them\u2014my mother shares my New York Public Library account and sometimes books just show up.**\\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to have one or two of those. I know I\u2019ve got a physics book. And Neil Gaiman\u2019s _Norse Mythology.__Do you have any last things to say in preparation for Travels with Terence?_I\u2019m just really excited to get started. Really honored to have the chance to work with these publishers and help them use Manifold to produce some really exciting and important works.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nThanks for reading!

This release adds new accessibility features, makes multiple improvements to the reading experience of Manifold, and expands the number of types of document formats that can be ingested by the platform. For details, please see below or watch this video overview:\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/289698661\\" width=\\"640\\" height=\\"360\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" webkitallowfullscreen=\\"\\" mozallowfullscreen=\\"\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\"></iframe>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Major Features\\n\\n**Audio Player** Audio resources will now render an audio player with volume control, scrubber, current time, and pause/play controls. A waveform of the audio file renders above the controls, which can also be used for moving the playhead.\\n\\n**Annotation Resilience** Manifold has a new service that attempts to reposition annotations in a text section after the text section has changed. Generally speaking, annotations are more resistant to changes in the underlying text. Prior to this release, changing and text node in a document could cause all annotations in that node and in child nodes to become orphaned.\\n\\n**Broad Accessibility Improvements** For the 2.0 release, we made significant progress toward making Manifold more accessible and ensuring that it remains accessible in future releases. We enabled a broad set of [jsx-a11y](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) linting rules and methodically adjusted our components to address linter warnings. While important, static code analysis is not a sufficient step to meet accessibility requirements, so we spent a good deal of time interacting with Manifold using a screen reader and making a variety of subjective and objective improvements for visually impaired users. For more information about what steps we took, please consult our [in-depth blog post](http://blog.manifoldapp.org/2018/08/08/web-accessibility-roadmap-for-manifold/) on the subject.\\n\\n**Contact Form** Manifold now ships with a contact form and corresponding mailer templates. If administrators want to make it easier for users to get in touch, they just enter a contact email in Manifold\u2019s settings, and the contact form will be enabled.\\n\\n**More Control Over the Footer** Publishers can now configure social links for the Manifold footer, control the global footer copyright statement, and add links to terms of service, a privacy policy, and other supplemental content that have been created on Manifold locally or that exist outside of the system.\\n\\n**Manifest Ingestion** We\u2019ve added a new ingestion strategy for \u201cmanifest\u201d ingestions. For this kind of ingestion, the user creates a YAML file that includes metadata about the text as well as the text\u2019s table of contents. Each entry in the manifest\u2019s TOC can reference, via URL or relative path to a file included in a zip archive, any kind of document\u2014except EPUB\u2014that Manifold is capable of ingesting (i.e., Markdown, HTML, Google Doc, Word Document). Each document will become a text section in a text. With this approach, it\u2019s possible to build Manifold texts out of disparate source documents. We\u2019ll be adding information about this new ingestion strategy to our documentation. In the meantime, we have a few sample manifests that we use for test fixtures. You can see those [here](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/blob/master/api/spec/data/ingestion/manifest/all_remote/) and [here](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/tree/master/api/spec/data/ingestion/manifest/all_local).\\n\\n**HTML Ingestion Improvements** Starting with version 2.0, Manifold is able to ingest a single stand-alone HTML file as well as a zip archive that includes one or more HTML files alongside supporting assets (stylesheets, images, etc.).\\n\\n**New Ingestion Formats** Manifold can now ingest Word documents and has very early support for LaTeX documents. We leverage PanDoc for converting these formats to HTML prior to ingestion. Manifold supports most default styles in Word documents, though more advanced layout and typesetting in Word may not translate well to Manifold\u2019s responsive reader. What is effectively a proof-of-concept ingestion process for LaTeX in version 2.0 will be further expanded in subsequent releases.\\n\\n**Document Ingestion Table of Contents** Any time a single document is ingested as a text, Manifold treats it as a document ingestion. Ingesting a single HTML file, a Google doc, a Markdown file, or a Word document would register as document ingestions. Prior to version 2.0, Manifold would not render a table of contents for these texts. In 2.0, Manifold will generate a table of contents for the text based on the headers in the document.\\n\\n**Custom OAuth Strategies** CUNY, one of the early adopters of Manifold, wants Manifold readers to be able to authenticate against Manifold using their CUNY Academic Commons login. To make that possible, we built interfaces into Manifold 2.0 so that instances can add custom OAuth authentication strategies to their installation. We\u2019re still working on developer documentation for this feature. Please get in touch with us on our [Slack channel](https://manifold-slackin.herokuapp.com/) if you\u2019d like to learn more in the meantime.\\n\\n**Refactored Ingestion** When we first started building Manifold, we mainly focused on being able to render EPUBs in Manifold\u2019s reader. Over time, we added new ingestion formats most of which were structurally different from EPUBs. Code around ingestion is one of the more complex and critical parts of Manifold, and our understanding of how ingestion should take place has grown over the last few years. For version 2.0, the ingestion process underwent a significant refactoring to make it more modular and to reduce the time involved in developing new strategies. Prior to this refactoring, every ingestion type was its own \u201cstrategy,\u201d and backend users had to identify which strategy they wanted to use. Going forward, we have a new architecture, which is composed of a number of services and objects:\\n\\n- **Fetchers** are responsible for pulling in documents from remote sources. Manifold ships with a \u201cURL\u201d fetcher and a \u201cGoogle Doc\u201d fetcher. We envision writing new fetchers for other services in the future (Dropbox Paper or Office 365, for example).\\n\\n- **Converters** are responsible for converting source documents to HTML, which is the lingua franca of Manifold ingestion. In version 2.0, Manifold includes convertors for LaTeX, Markdown, and Microsoft Word.\\n\\n- **Strategies** are responsible for inspecting source documents and organizing them into models that Manifold understands including Texts, Text Sections, Text Titles, Contributors, etc. Each strategy produces a structured data hash which gets passed on to compilers.\\n\\n- **Compilers** are responsible for taking the data produced by the ingestion strategy and creating data models in Manifold\u2019s database. Manifold includes compilers for Contributors, Creators, IngestionSources, Makers, Stylesheets, Texts, TextSections, and TextTitles.\\n\\n- **Pickers** are responsible for polling converters, fetchers, and strategies to determine which should be applied to each model. We\u2019ve added a configuration layer that we\u2019ll expose in a future release, which will allow developers to add custom converters, strategies, and fetchers to Manifold.\\n\\n- We\u2019ve added **pre- and post-processing stages** to ingestion to allow us to extract stylesheets, add IDs to headers for TOC generation, and other small adjustments. We will likely expose these steps for customization in the future.\\n\\nWith the more modular architecture, we expect to be able to roll out ingestion fixes and improvements more quickly while also adding support for new formats and content sources. As part of this work, we\u2019ve also improved the ingestion user interface. We\u2019ve moved it from a modal to a drawer, added automated detection for ingestion type, and generally improved the usability of the UI.\\n\\n**CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 18 Support** For this release, we circled back to our Omnibus tooling for generating OS-level Manifold packages and added support for CentOS 7 (as well as RHEL 7) and Ubuntu 18. As always, these packages are available from [our downloads page](https://manifoldapp.org/docs/reference/downloads), and we\u2019ve updated installation instructions to include [CentOS](https://manifoldapp.org/docs/installing/centos/index).\\n\\n**Support for Very Large Ingestions** In version 1.0, we relied on Javascript File APIs for handling the uploaded ingestion file. With time, we found that those interfaces tended to fail when dealing with files over 150 or 200MB. Many of our users are attracted to Manifold as a reading platform because of its support for multimedia, which means we need to be able to support very large ingestion sources. To solve this, we changed the way Manifold handles uploads for ingestions. We followed the TUS specification ([https://tus.io/](https://tus.io/)), which means that Manifold also now can show accurate upload progress and offer resumable uploads for ingestion source files. Version 2.0 should have no problem supporting ingestions that are multiple gigabytes in size.\\n\\n**Backend Design Changes** The Manifold 1.0 backend was more confusing than it needed to be. For 2.0, we adjusted backend navigation and added secondary navigation. We improved the design of the tertiary navigation on complex records (projects, texts, resources, etc), and did a careful UX pass on the record header component to signal more clearly where users were in the hierarchy of project and project child records. We dropped the confusing \u201cpeople\u201d and \u201ccontent\u201d sections in the backend and moved these auxiliary models under a catch-all \u201crecords\u201d label. We added an \u201call projects\u201d backend view which leaves us with room to add project collections in 2.1 or 3.0. We normalized backend routes and fixed a number of issues with backend navigation active states. We added multiple columns to forms and made a number of backend typography and layout improvements.\\n\\n**Text Downloads** In addition to offering readers the option of purchasing a text (by way of an external URL), editors may now attach a downloadable version of a text, which could be a PDF or an EPUB and allow users to download it for offline reading.\\n\\n**Email Notifications** Many readers and editors have asked to be notified when content is added to a Manifold installation. Users can now manage their notification preferences for Manifold and ask to be notified when people reply to their comments or annotations. Users can also configure their account so that they receive email notification whenever new content is added to projects they follow; notification can take the form of a daily email or a weekly digest. Backend users can be notified when content is flagged as inappropriate or when any new comment or annotation is posted on a project for which they have editorial access.\\n\\n**So Many Bug Fixes** For 2.0, we\u2019ve fixed over a hundred bugs and made many, many small improvements to Manifold. Manifold is now tighter, more polished, and more stable!\\n\\n## Minor Features\\n\\n In addition to the features outlined above, Manifold 2.0 ships with the following minor features:\\n \\n- Collection description fields now accept Markdown, which makes it possible to link to external sites and add formatting.\\n- All fields that accept Markdown formatting now accept Markdown links.\\n- When there are no projects for a Manifold instance, Manifold will now display placeholder content.\\n- The pagination and filters on the backend project lists are sticky, so if you go to a project and come back to the list, you\u2019ll be in the same place.\\n- Rows can be flagged as \u2018skipped\u2019 when bulk importing project resources, which is helpful for resources that are still in progress or provisional.\\n- Bulk resource importer supports associating a resource with a collection.\\n- We\u2019ve updated React to the most recent version, which brings stability and performance improvements.\\n- We\u2019ve tried to make ingestion error messages easier to track and understand. We\u2019re continuing to make improvements here!\\n- Manifold can now accept OpenOffice, Flash Video, and Ogg uploads for resources.\\n- We\u2019ve exposed the resource fingerprint (used for bulk resource imports) and the resource URL slug fields in the backend.\\n- Texts that do not have a table of contents now render an appropriate message in the reader\u2019s TOC drawer.\\n- Manifold installations can customize how page titles are generated.\\n- Manifold can now handle texts that have different stylesheets applied to one or more sections. In version 1.0, text stylesheets were global to the text rather than section-specific.\\n- We\u2019ve added a \u201cpurpose\u201d field to page records so that Manifold can automatically link to terms of service and privacy policies in appropriate places.\\n- We now render resource download variants on resource detail view.\\n- Improved IE11 and Edge support."},{"id":"tenpublisherstobeginusingmanifold","metadata":{"permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/tenpublisherstobeginusingmanifold","source":"@site/blog/2018-08-30-ten-publishers-to-begin-using-manifold.md","title":"Ten publishers to begin using Manifold platform to publish scholarly work","description":"MINNEAPOLIS, MN (August 30, 2018)\u2014The Manifold team has selected the following ten groups to receive free installation and training on the Manifold platform to help them meet their digital publishing goals:","date":"2018-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.86,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"tenpublisherstobeginusingmanifold","title":"Ten publishers to begin using Manifold platform to publish scholarly work"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Manifold Version 2.0 Overview","permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/manifoldversion20overview"},"nextItem":{"title":"Preserving Manifold Editions: Topics of Consideration","permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/preservingmanifoldeditionstopicsofconsideration"}},"content":"MINNEAPOLIS, MN (August 30, 2018)\u2014The Manifold team has selected the following ten groups to receive free installation and training on the Manifold platform to help them meet their digital publishing goals:\\n\\n- Athabasca University Press,\\n- the University of Cincinnati Press and Library Publishing Services,\\n- Concordia University Press,\\n- Emory Center for Digital Scholarship,\\n- Indiana University Press,\\n- Liverpool University Press,\\n- Reanimate publishing collective,\\n- Temple University Press,\\n- the University of Washington Press and Libraries, and\\n- the University of the West Indies Press.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThese groups represent university presses, university library publishing groups, humanities centers, and a collective of scholars from across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the West Indies, each seeking an alternative editorial path for digital scholarly publishing.\\n\\nDoug Armato, University of Minnesota Press Director, says, \u201cWe are excited to have this opportunity to help other university presses, library publishing groups, and university centers install and get started in using the Manifold platform as part of their work to publish scholarship on the web.

Publishers, authors, and the communities they serve need to be confident the materials they are publishing on Manifold will not only be discoverable, but also reliably accessible and useable for future engagement.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Challenges\\n\\nManifold and other nascent publishing platforms enable scholars to explore multimodal forms of expression.[^1] Presently, however, there are no established standards for the preservation of long-form scholarship made up of collections of interrelated multimedia materials or materials in various states of completeness, which might also be entwined with conversations occurring in social media and/or the platform\'s own native annotation and commenting system.\\n\\nThe Manifold team is composed of a [publisher](https://www.upress.umn.edu/), a [digital humanities center](https://gcdsl.commons.gc.cuny.edu/), and a [development agency](http://castironcoding.com/)\u2014our missions haven\'t historically centered around preservation. To engage with the question of preservation earnestly, we first need to better understand the ecosystem, expectations, and available options. A good part of the work we are presently undertaking is in educating ourselves, through independent research and in talking with librarians and other experts to help us craft a course that meets the needs of our users today and the needs of users years hence. Those needs inform two very simple questions that are foundational to our endeavor: What are we preserving and how are we preserving it?\\n\\nFor multimodal projects, the question of _what_ may be simple, but it\'s certainly not easy, and the implications of exploring it are, well, manifold. For instance, do we want to be opinionated about preserving works in progress versus a peer-reviewed version of record? What constitutes the version of record when there isn\'t a corresponding print edition? Does that answer affect the mechanisms of preservation we\'re enabling, or is that a question best reserved for individual publishers? What about comments authors and readers have made on the system? Should we aim to make it possible to preserve all of them? Just a subset? The public ones, or perhaps a select, curated collection? What about those comments that are part of classroom work? How do we signal such intent to those making the comments, and does that alter their possible engagement? What about interactions brought in through social media? And then there are ancillary resources. Do we simply preserve the source files and their metadata, or do we work to make them relational to their placement/function in and around the text they are supporting? What about resources that the platform isn\'t hosting\u2014do we want to only preserve their metadata or can/should we go further? How does all of this work if a publisher has enabled a paywall (a forthcoming Manifold feature)? \\n\\nThe _how_ of this equation is a bit more straightforward. Generally speaking there are a three approaches, beyond redundancy, to preserving digital materials: bitwise, migration, and emulation.\\n\\nBitwise preservation takes the ones and zeros that make up the materials in the computer system and exports them out exactly as is from start to finish, in order. This captures the content accurately, but it may or may not be usable for researchers now, depending on the capabilities of the holding agency, and there\'s no guarantee it will be usable in the future if the required software to engage with the material is no longer supported.\\n\\nA migratory approach is transformative, converting the content from one format to another (e.g., from a Word document to XML). This approach has multiple benefits: it ensures that the essential elements of the scholarship is preserved (hopefully in an open and extensible format as a guard against obsolescence) while also remaining accessible and usable. This is a targeted strategy that looks at the content itself independent of any software required to run it. It also necessitates intermittent review for possible further transformations. While it would be ideal to retain the exact look and feel of the original expression, the focus here is on the content itself versus any specific rendering of it.\\n\\nThe last approach, emulation, looks to preserve both the content and the software used to run it as a means to exactly recreate the original experience. This path requires the most intensive amount of upkeep to maintain fidelity with the original while maintaining code that will at some point fall out of favor.[^2]\\n\\nIt is worth nothing that none of these approaches are mutually exclusive. Indeed a good preservation strategy is likely to involve more than one of these paths. And which path, or combination of paths chosen, will help determine the underlying mechanics of how we enable the preservation of Manifold content. Our current thinking favors the migratory approach and its focus on maintaining the material in a usable and extensible format that can evolve with new standards while maintaining fidelity to the original scholarship. It\'s possible our solution will involve a strategy to export projects as EPUBs or, maybe, by exporting all the source text and metadata in JSON and packaging it with the supporting ancillary resources for keeping in third-party preservation agencies/systems or institutional repositories (IRs).[^3] It may mean something somewhat different yet as different kinds of resources have different needs (e.g., independent apps that are made part of a project as a resource may require a more emulative approach).\\n\\nAs we navigate these questions, we\'re also going to need to appreciate nuanced legal and social concerns. Beyond the copyright, licensing, and permission obligations authors and publishers must work through, there are also ethical and moral issues involved in the collection, publication, and storage of source materials of which we must be cognizant and respectful. In the same way we must also be respectful of those users who engage with and possibly contribute to scholarship on Manifold in a material way through their annotations and comments.\\n\\n## Progress So Far\\n\\n While we\'re still early in phase 2, preservation is an issue we\'ve already begun exploring with zeal. Informally, this has been a topic of interest and rich discussion with our collaborators at the University of Michigan and New York University. In September we\'ll be workshopping this issue more formally with those groups in Ann Arbor, by generous invitation from Charles Watkinson, alongside fellow stakeholders from Stanford University Press, librarians from both the University of Minnesota and the University of Michigan, and representatives from Portico, CLOCKSS, and HathiTrust.\\n \\n This past spring we not only had the privilege to take part in the Library Publishing Forum\'s preconference, we also benefited from the various sessions that spoke to preservation and from all the perspectives and expertise of the many thought leaders who were present that week. Cliff Lynch\'s [closing comments](https://www.pscp.tv/LibPubCoalition/1BdxYRymRNYKX) to the preconference, especially, serve as a charge and reminder of the serious import of creating the means to preserve those materials our platform enables.\\n \\n As Jojo noted in [her recent post](http://blog.manifoldapp.org/2018/08/17/manifold-meeting-in-minnesota/) about our Manifold team meeting in Minneapolis, we\'ve also met with members of the University of Minnesota Library specializing in digital preservation. Being able to present Manifold in person to library staff at a major research institution and solicit their feedback and suggestions was a fantastic opportunity for us generally, and particularly invaluable as we continue to think through how best for Manifold to function in this space. Meeting with library staff who are expert in digital preservation is something we made a cornerstone issue as part of our phase 2 roadmad, and in the coming months we will also be meeting in person with library personnel at both CUNY and the University of Oregon to both inform future development plans as well as review the progress we\'ve made.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\n While we are still in an information gathering mode, we also now have enough background to begin building a story around this issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/) that Zach and his team at Cast Iron can use to start developing the tools and means to export content from Manifold. That story is likely to go live on GitHub in mid-September, and we\'ll announce when it does via social media and our newsletter so those who are interested can review it and make recommendations.\\n \\n In conjunction with our upcoming meetings, we\'ll be in conversation with the major preservation agencies to not only help inform our platform\'s preservation methods but also hopefully forge technical connections with them. Thus if publisher has a relationship with an agency, they can easily prepare an export of their content that the agency would be able to use.\\n \\n When these features are more realized and the clouds of construction clear, we will be crafting a template preservation statement that publishers can use to clearly outline to their authors and readers what materials they are preserving, what materials _aren\'t_ being preserved, what agencies are involved and their own level of commitment, and the means and strategies by which the preservation process is working.[^4] This template will be constructed so as to be easily customizable based on the choices within Manifold a publisher has made.\\n\\n\\\\* \\\\* \\\\*\\n\\n For publishers who have never before extended themselves into this arena, it can seem overwhelming at first. Our experience thus far though has made it clear to us that the preservation of digital scholarship is equally as important as publishing it. We are committed to crafting the means for you to do so confidently and in ways that leverage your existing processes and relationships.\\n \\n If you have input on this matter you\'d like us to consider or are actively working on issues of digital preservation and have a perspective you\'d like to share, we invite you to do so in the comments below or on our [Slack channel](https://manifold-slackin.herokuapp.com/).\\n\\n \u2014Terence Smyre, Manifold Digital Projects Editor\\n\\n[^1]: Other platforms exploring this new publishing space include [Scalar](https://scalar.me/anvc/), Michigan\'s [Fulcrum](https://www.fulcrum.org/), Getty\'s [Quire](https://www.getty.edu/publications/digital/platforms-tools.html), and Stanford University Press\'s [digital publishing initiative](https://www.sup.org/digital/).\\n[^2]: The [Smithsonian Institution Archives](https://siarchives.si.edu/what-we-do/digital-curation/preservation-strategies-born-digital-materials) provides a nice summary of the different preservation strategies, as does the University of Michigan Library\'s [Digital Preservation Unit](https://www.lib.umich.edu/preservation-and-conservation/digital-preservation-unit).\\n[^3]: Our aim is to make it possible for publishers to easily integrate with those preservations systems with whom they may already have an established relationship\u2014[Fulcrum](https://www.fulcrum.org/), [Portico](https://www.portico.org/), [LOCKSS](https://www.lockss.org/), [CLOCKSS](https://www.clockss.org/clockss/Home), [HathiTrust](https://www.hathitrust.org/)\u2014while still providing a means for those who don\'t have such relationships to output their content in sensible ways for their IR.\\n[^4]: Much of our thinking around a preservation statement comes from Jeremy Morse at the University of Michigan as well as other participants at the 2018 Library Publishing Forum in Minneapolis.

Zach ran through the progress Cast Iron Coding has made, walking us all through the [road map on Github](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/projects/7). Much of the recent development work has focused on improving accessibility standards and adding support for new formats (Word documents and LaTeX) that Manifold can ingest directly into the reader.\\n\\nIn the roadmap discussion, we talked a lot about the different ways that publishers are using Manifold and about how project home pages, which are currently uniform, could become more flexible to accommodate those varying use cases. We spent time discussing those use cases, determining what should they be called, and thinking through what they would comprise\u2014what, for instance, makes a journal a journal and not a multiple author open educational resource? Our thoughts on all of these matters have been informed and inspired by Manifold users, who have consistently come to us with questions and thoughts about how the platform can be expanded in new ways. As Niels-Oliver Walkowski said on Manifold\u2019s public [Slack channel](https://manifold-slackin.herokuapp.com/), \u201cThe prospects look really exciting.\u201d\\n\\nLooking ahead to version 3.0, Manifold has plans for project templates and theming. As the Cast Iron team continues to improve accessibility and ease of implementation for all users, we are also considering the balance between user control and user responsibility. Manifold has worked hard to establish a platform that is both flexible for publishers and streamlined enough to provide for a seamless and uniform user experience.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-16-at-9.10.30-AM.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nVersion 4.0 will focus on providing publishers the means to set up Manifold instances that are oriented around single projects, as an alternative to the default library view, where readers peruse a publisher\'s entire catalog. With the single-project setup, publishers will still have the ability to publish on Manifold as many projects as they would like, using only one backend interface. However, projects would now each have their own distinct web presence, allowing them to be more neatly nested into existing websites and offering those who only have a handful of projects for the platform the means to present them in a more appropriate way. Annotation groups\u2014useful for classes or groups of readers who would like to comment on a text together\u2014are also on deck for version 4.0. The team had a provocative conversation about what degree of administration and content moderation Manifold should accommodate. Peer review and classroom contexts had everyone thinking carefully about who monitors what and where.\\n\\nThe conversation about preservation and programmatic ingestion slated for version 5.0 brought up a series of questions about what responsibility Manifold has to preserve its interactive components and primed us for our planned meeting with the Minnesota library team. The resource capabilities Manifold offers present the greatest challenges in terms of preservation. Not only do rich resources raise questions of simulation versus static preservation, but interactive content in the form of annotations and reader contributions also poses rights and copyright concerns. Would saving content for the authors and other readers require that Manifold users agree to a creative commons license before publishing any material or leaving any annotations on a text? Would Manifold need to support the moderation of such content? Read on for an overview of our library notes and stay tuned for Terence\u2019s blog post addressing Manifold\u2019s plans for preservation.\\n\\nMany notes were taken and issues were written before we made our way to the food truck alley. Turning the corner of an otherwise sensible-looking downtown, we came to the veritable parade of colorful trucks purveying everything from organic egg sandwiches to artisan tacos. We ate on the steps in the open air, enjoying each other\u2019s company and talking of travels. Evidently there is a very cold lake near Portland and gauntlets may have been thrown for the next meeting.\\n\\nIn the afternoon, we reconvened to discuss project collections. Much consideration was given to anything that required user input. Still pleased with James Baker\u2019s [comment](https://twitter.com/j_w_baker/status/1004630774904172544) that Manifold is \u201cpleasingly unfussy,\u201d the team is wary of anything that might introduce bothersome fuss.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-17-at-8.37.11-AM.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nIt\u2019s been nice catching all the nice things people are saying as they try out version 1.0.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-16-at-9.10.56-AM.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nWith what energy remained, we talked through the Manifold Digital Services business model. We thought through what people seem most curious about with Manifold. Rather that reviewing features for new users, we want to refocus the conversation and start highlighting the problems Manifold solves for publishers.\\n\\nThursday we met first at the Wilson Library with John Butler, Associate University Librarian for Data & Technology; Emma Molls, Publishing Services Librarian; Jon Nichols, Director of Digital Preservation and Repository Technologies; Kate McCready, Director of Content Services; Carol Kussmann, Digital Preservation Analyst; and Stacie Traill, Metadata Analyst. After Zach presented Manifold, nearly forgetting to demonstrate the share features to cite or link social media which drew exclamations of awe from all present, we dug deep into conversation about preservation. Meeting with the library team offered us not only the chance to talk about Manifold specifically, but also to learn more about library processes for preserving web-based content and to discuss how we might strategically position Manifold to work well with those processes and workflows.\\n\\nWith expertise in the room from so many library departments, the Manifold team was able to ask what each anticipates from publishers and what resources they have to preserve interactive content. The conversation naturally turned to the broader philosophical concerns. What is the responsibility of preservation of a Manifold edition\u2014how much interactivity must you preserve? what permissions would be needed to preserve annotations? what solutions are the libraries pursuing? We learned a bit about the University of Minnesota Libraries digital asset management and preservation solution, Rosetta, and about the best practices the libraries use for preserving a record of digital objects.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/08/IMG_3723.jpg\').default}\\n    alt=\\"a live sketch of the Manifold team at the UMN library meeting\u2014Susan Doerr, Doug Armato, Matt Gold, and Zach Davis.\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption>Jojo live sketches the Manifold team at the UMN library meeting\u2014Susan Doerr, Doug Armato, Matt Gold, and Zach Davis.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nWe made our way next to Cafe Alma for a delicious lunch and coffee while we reviewed the wonderful applications for the Manifold Digital Services Pilot Program and considered the ways Manifold could work across the richly varied use cases.\\n\\nBack at the press office, Zach ran a demo for press employees. Everyone seemed excited with more smiles than questions. After knocking out some ideas for templates for Manifold projects, we were ready to end the day with a quick bite to eat at a local spot. We made it to the bistro around the corner before the downpour! Getting caught in the rain, we were surprised to be captivated by American Ninja Warrior, which happened to be broadcasting on the bar televisions. Feats of strength and ingenious maneuvers seem oddly appropriate to the hurdles and hijinks of digital edition development.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-17-at-10.16.37-AM.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"An illustration of a pumpkin head clothed in Renaissance attire.\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption>Sometimes dummy text and makeshift categories show up in demos.

We dug into templates\u2014what are the logical ways to present simple or enhanced books? &nbsp;Journals or Open Educational Resources? Resource-only projects? Conceiving user interactions for each case, we oscillated between the practical and the philosophical. What do these terms historically evoke and how does Manifold most easily accommodate both the conceptual and functional needs? With the combination of UMP team\u2019s broad array of publishing experience, Matt\u2019s deep familiarity with researchers\u2019 needs, and Zach\u2019s tactical ingenuity for development, we came to a [list of templates](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/1209), that should serve us well without overcomplicating the user experience. These include Simple Book, Enhanced Book, Journal or Collection from single source, Journal or Collection from multiple sources, OER or Teaching Resource, Report or Handbook, and Resource Only. Follow [Manifold on Github](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold) to see the design progress.\\n\\nWith version 2.0 rolling out soon, Terence hitting the trail for Digital Services trainings, the CUNY Manifold revving up to the edge, everyone\u2019s got a lot going on before we meet again in November in Portland.

In this document we\u2019ll explore the guidelines used in determining an acceptable level of accessibility, the best tools to aid in development, what AT compatibility pitfalls to avoid, and the strategies for continuing development. Hopefully this document will outline what work has been completed thus far, as well as describe some best practices for moving forward.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Guidelines\\n\\nThe Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG), under the umbrella of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), have created a truly comprehensive set of accessibility guidelines\u2014[WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/)\u2014for acceptable and responsible web accessibility. (The guidelines are also available with a slightly more friendly interface [here](http://romeo.elsevier.com/accessibility_checklist/).) Not only do they include considerations for almost every conceivable type of web interaction, element, and piece of content, they have also developed a rubric for measuring your compliance and, to some extent, provide strategies for achieving compliance. Some of these guidelines find their genesis in the [Section 508 amendment to the US Rehabilitation Act of 1973](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards/), which sought to address requirements for US government website accessibility. The WCAG is an indispensable resource for this kind of work and, on Manifold, I find myself referring to it almost every time I tackle a web accessibility issue. We currently only endeavor to meet the minimum standards, and we track our general progress in this [Github issue checklist of W3C 2.0 Accessibility Guidelines](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/1037).\\n\\n## Tools\\n\\nThere are [several tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/) that help you evaluate any website\u2019s general level of WCAG compliance. Many of these tools are browser-based and do a fairly good job of scraping a website\u2019s content, given a url, and outputting a list of criteria met, exceeded, or not met. And while sometimes it is helpful to use the browser to evaluate compliance, for Manifold it is most helpful to evaluate compliance while you\u2019re developing in real-time (or when the React components build). To aid in this endeavor we use [jsx-a11y](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y), a JSX linter that flags possible WCAG exceptions; [Sim Daltonism](https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/), a color blindness simulator; a browser-based [color contrast inspector](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/); and [VoiceOver](https://help.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/10.12/), the default macOS screen reader.\\n\\n### Linter\\n\\n[Jsx-a11y](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) has a set of [fully customizable rules](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/tree/master/docs/rules) almost all of which neatly line up with an article of the WCAG. Each supported rule is listed in the `.eslintrc` config file. A `2` value for a rule indicates it is active. Those rules that are not currently active are either not applicable to Manifold or evaluate guideline conditions beyond our compliance baseline. As new features are added to Manifold, or existing components are refactored, it is crucial to pay close attention to the errors and warnings the linter provides during builds, as they fairly consistently indicate a problem for AT. However, the linter is not infallible and, should a component get flagged that performs on AT as expected, [inline linter rule overrides](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#disabling-rules-with-inline-comments) may be used judiciously.\\n\\n### Color Contrast Checker\\nOne type of evaluation the jsx-a11y linter will not assist with is problematic color contrasts. The [WebAIM: Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) takes a text color and a background color, uses the WCAG minimum color contrast ratios as benchmarks, and determines whether the combination of colors meet those benchmarks. Meeting these minimum contrasts is crucial for maintaining legibility of text against a background color. However it\u2019s important to maintain Manifold\u2019s branded color scheme, and respect the design in general, so all such issues should be addressed in coordination with a designer.\\n\\n### Color Blindness Checker\\nA tool to assist in determining the impact of color combinations on those with various forms of color blindness is [Sim Daltonism](https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/). This color blindness simulator lets you preview how how folks with various forms of color blindness will perceive various content. It doesn\u2019t output any metrics (just a visual representation) so you have to make your own decisions as to what is or isn\u2019t legible but it does provide a quick reference when making changes to address color combination concerns.\\n\\n### Screen Reader\\n\\nFinally, as with so much frontend development, sometimes the best test is trying stuff out yourself. Just as you wouldn\u2019t make general alterations to the user interface, or other visual components, without interacting with them yourself in various browsers, it is just as important to test recent updates in screen readers too. [A recent study estimated](https://nfb.org/blindness-statistics) that as much as 2.7 percent of the US adult population is blind (6,833,000 folks). [Another study suggests](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey5/) 5 percent of AT users do not \u201cuse a screen reader due to a disability.\u201d For a sighted-user, a UX (user experience) issue might only present an annoyance or visual discrepancy. However, a web accessibility issue leaves fundamental interactions ineffectual or whole swaths of content unavailable to an AT User. And, given the above statistics, that could mean 7,000,000 folks can\u2019t use your website as intended.\\n\\nThe default screen reader in macOS is Voiceover. [According to one survey](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey5/#used) it is the third most used screen reader (coming in behind two windows only screen readers: NVDA and JAWS) but, like testing in Chrome first, testing web accessibility in Voiceover still provides an middling baseline. However, just like web browsers, there are breaking differences between the popular screen readers.\\n\\n## AT Compatibility\\n\\nWhen we use a CSS property, JavaScript method, or HTML5 attribute in a new frontend feature, we rely on sites like [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) to determine if that feature will behave the same across modern browsers. When developing for screen readers we often make use of AT specific HTML attributes called [ARIA attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/) and there are [resources similar to Can I Use](https://www.powermapper.com/tests/screen-readers/aria/) to help us determine what ARIA attributes are compatible across which screen readers. In some cases using an ARIA attribute is the best way to supply information to AT. In other cases it is merely the most convenient. However in most cases (for instance alt text on images or labels for form fields) there is another way to supply the desired information to AT totally independently of ARIA. If so, this is always the preferred solution as it stands the best chance of being presented by various screen readers in the same manner.\\n\\n## Maintaining and Extending Accessibility Features\\n\\nMost of the web accessibility work for Manifold is concerned with making the unseen seen on AT. In most cases this means supplying a text alternative to a visual-only element. In this section we\u2019ll review some of the general strategies and unique challenges to improving Manifold\u2019s web accessibility.\\n\\n### Alt Text\\n\\nSo much of adapting content to AT is giving a screen reader something to read. On Manifold, visual content not \u201cread\u201d by the screen reader loosely calls into three categories: presentational, content, and interactive.\\n\\n#### Presentational\\n\\nA presentational image is one that is corollary or even superfluous to the information with which it is associated. One example of this might be the waveform imagery displayed as part of the Audio Resource player: someone using AT can still use the player, enjoy and control the audio, and get information about the audio presented, without ever seeing the animated waveform. A sighted user\u2019s experience might be different, but it is not dramatically improved by, or dependent on, the presence of the waveform. In most cases, presentational elements should be hidden to AT as their inclusion tends to clutter up and slow down screen reader navigation. There are three main ways to hide content from AT:\\n\\n- Use `display: none`. Setting an element\u2019s display property to none effectively removes an element from the DOM flow. Similarly it will also hide it from a screen reader. Be aware, CSS-only strategies that visually hide elements (e.g., setting `visibility: hidden`, absolutely positioning an element out of view, etc.) **do not** hide elements from screen readers.\\n- Use the `hidden=\\"true\\"` attribute. Like `display: none`, this will remove the element from the flow in **both** the browser and the screen reader. Unlike using CSS, this attribute instructs the browser to set the element as `display: none` and, as such, it\u2019s often easier to conditionally toggle.\\n- Use `aria-hidden=\\"true\\"` attribute. This attribute is supported across all modern screen readers and will have the same effect as `hidden=\\"true\\"` except it will **only** be hidden for screen readers. This attribute should not be used on interactive/focusable elements as many screen readers will not respect it (the element will still be focusable but the screen reader won\u2019t \u201cread\u201d anything to the user).\\n\\n#### Content\\n\\nA content image is an image that provides vital information on its own or provides meaningful context to accompanying content. Alternative text should always be provided for such content. If the image is rendered as an `img` tag this text should be supplied in the `alt` attribute (`<img src=\\"/path/to/image\\" alt=\\"description of image\\">`). If the image is rendered as a background image, or some other CSS-based method, the alternative text should be provided in an element visually hidden in the browser but still available in the DOM flow (and therefore the accessibility tree). In Manifold we have created a class called `screen-reader-text` which accomplishes just this. We also have a convention of using a `span` tag for such elements (i.e., `<span class=\\"screen-reader-text\\">Text visible to the screen reader</span>`).\\n\\n#### Interactive\\n\\nIn Manifold, interactive images are often buttons or links (or other elements made interactive through JavaScript) whose only content is an image or icon. And while using clear bold iconography can often streamline UX, such interactions tend to hamper AT if they are unadorned by text. In most cases alternative text should be supplied in the same manner used for content images, for instance `<button class=\\"fancy-icon-button\\">Text describing interaction</button>`.\\n\\n### Roles\\n\\nThe [role attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#allowed-aria-roles-states-and-properties) helps inform the browser and AT how an element will behave. In most cases we can avoid clashes between an element\u2019s role and its [implied semantics](https://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html5_semantic_elements.asp) by using a more appropriate element in its place. Strive to maintain the implicit role of an HTML element as it will function as expected across browsers and AT much more consistently than those elements with roles overriding their semantic (intended) function. In some cases we should add a role attribute to reinforce an implicit role. In other cases, where styled markup and JavaScript logic already exist, the role attribute can provide the browser and AT information about an element\u2019s function that supersedes the function implied by the tag (i.e., when a `span` or `div` is treated as an interactive element). And in some rare cases we use `role=\\"presentational\\"` to effectively strip an element\u2019s semantic role away (leaving it still \u201creadable\u201d by AT but no longer treated as an interactive element).\\n\\n### Form Labels\\n\\nIt\u2019s easy to ignore form field labels, or supply descriptive text some other way, or to treat the label tags only as a tool for getting [WTF-forms CSS hacks](http://wtfforms.com/) to work, but AT deeply rely on the presence and strong association of labels with form elements.\\n\\nA label indicates a field\u2019s purpose, as placeholder text is not always read by screen readers and input types can be too general to be considered adequately informative. Because of this, it is not only vital that the label is present, it\u2019s important that its contents is human readable. For instance, in some screen readers, if you wrap a `select` with a label, the screen reader will read out all of the options as if they were the text description of the `select` field.\\n\\nIt is also important to strongly associate a label to its form field. This is done by assigning a unique id to the form field and using that id as the value of the [`for` attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_for.asp) (or in React the [`htmlFor` attribute](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#htmlfor)) on the label. There are also [ARIA attributes that can be used to provide form field descriptions](https://webaim.org/techniques/forms/advanced) to screen readers, and they should **not** be used in conjunction with a label tag, as only one will be read (with the exception of the `aria-describedby` attribute whose value is read in addition to any label text). In most cases an \u201cinvisible\u201d label tag can be used instead of an ARIA attribute and is the preferred solution for showing an AT-only label.\\n\\n### Form Errors and Notifications\\n\\nWe want errors to be read by AT early and often. When feasible, as soon as they are visible on the page (this is usually immediately after a form has been submitted) they should also be automatically read by the screen reader. Subsequently, error messages should be easily identifiable, as unavoidable as possible, and should persist as long as the form is not submittable.\\n\\nIn general form errors on Manifold always appear next to the field with the error. For AT this is not ideal (it\u2019s much more convenient to have all of the errors routed to a single element\u2014like a flash message\u2014all the time), but we can well accommodate this placement by using the role attribute in conjunction with a handful of other ARIA attributes. The `role=\\"alert\\"` attribute lets the AT know it should immediately read the text in this element when it is rendered on the page. This role also implicitly makes the element a \u201c[live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions)\u201d which means AT can tell when there are changes to this area and then make choices accordingly. We affect how/when the contents in the live region gets read (and re-read) by using two other ARIA attributes.\\n\\n- The [`aria-atomic` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions#Advanced_Live_Regions) tells AT to read the entire contents of the live region every time any of it is updated.\\n- The [`aria-live` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions#Preferring_Specialized_Live_Region_Roles) tells AT when to read the contents of the element, in relation to other live regions, and in relation to any user interactions. The most well supported `aria-live` value is `polite`, which will wait for any pending DOM interactions to finish, also wait for any content already being read by a screen reader to finish, and then read the contents of that live region. In the case of our error messages, we use a value of `assertive`, which will interrupt anything being read and immediately announce the error. This value is not fully supported across all screen readers but will fallback to the behavior of an element with `aria-live=\\"polite\\"`.\\n\\nFinally we use the [`aria-describedby` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-describedby_attribute) to create a relationship between the error text and the form field with which it is associated. We do this so that after the error text is read once (due to `role=\\"alert\\"`) it will be read again whenever its associated form field receives focus. This is important as it guides the screen reader user through the form as they make corrections (i.e., they don\u2019t have to remember what the errors are when they\u2019re read the first time; they can read them as many times as they need as they re-traverse a form with errors).\\n\\n### Controlling Focus\\n\\n[Hijacking focus is surely frowned upon](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0#on-focus), not only for web accessibility reasons, as it runs the risk of confusing or displacing the user, but also for any user\u2019s experience. However, used judiciously, [redirecting focus](https://medium.com/@matuzo/writing-javascript-with-accessibility-in-mind-a1f6a5f467b9) can make it easier for a user, especially an AT user, to understand where they are on the page and what interaction is expected of them. In some cases this is as simple as focusing on a the first form field when a form is rendered on the page: this immediately presents the most important interaction to the user (filling out the form) and keeps the user from having to navigate page content that otherwise may not have changed. Sometimes it means controlling the focus using JavaScript in order to maintain a complicated DOM flow. However, sometimes redirecting focus isn\u2019t enough of a provocation.\\n\\nIn the case of interactions that present the user with a disparate element like a drawer, overlay, dialog box, dropdown menu, etc., we not only want to the redirect focus to an element inside the drawer, we also want to ensure that the user interacts with the contents of that element before it is hidden. To accomplish this we\u2019ll use a strategy called a [focus trap](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap-react) to restrict the user to the active element.\\n\\nLet\u2019s use the example of a dialog box containing a prompt asking you to \u201cConfirm the deletion of Text X\u201d, with \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cCancel\u201d buttons. For the sighted user this confirmation dialog takes over the whole screen. Using a mouse to navigate the page, the user must click \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cCancel\u201d to continue. And this makes sense. We want the user to have to make a decision. If this confirmation dialog wasn\u2019t a takeover, the user might click \u201cDelete\u201d and move on, not noticing or realizing they needed to confirm their choice. So, to emulate this behavior on AT, we use a focus trap to restrict focus to only elements inside the confirmation dialog. If the user is tabbing through content, AT will read the prompt and the buttons text over and over until they interact with one or the other button. If we don\u2019t enact a focus trap, AT would allow the user to tab through and then out of the dialog, continuing to traverse the page as normal and, depending on the contents of that dialog, this could have unwanted consequences. So, to reiterate, in this simple example, we will use a focus trap to ensure that when a user activates the confirmation dialog they won\u2019t miss the messaging, and they will be required to interact with it before moving on, just as a non-AT user would do. Not all uses of the focus trap are so simple, but the [react-focus-trap component](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap-react) we use offers enough options and flexibility to implement it effectively without too many concessions.\\n\\nOne important consideration when using a focus trap: if we\u2019ve trapped focus inside a dialog, drawer, etc., we must provide them with an interaction to escape the trap. In most cases we can provide a default \u201cpress esc key to close,\u201d but this should be used in addition to an \u201con screen\u201d interaction. Usually we provide a close button inside the focus trap to allow the user to escape the trap without having affected any other change. In some cases we only need to make this close button available to AT as some other click-based interaction is otherwise available.\\n\\n### Nav Skip\\n\\nIn the most basic sense, AT reads the page from top to bottom every time the page loads. This can hamper UX on a screen reader as it might force a user to traverse the same content over and over as they navigate between pages. In addition to simply tabbing through content, most AT will sort page content in enough different ways to allow the user to access whatever part of the page is most relevant to them. However, we want to encourage users to easily access the most relevant content as quickly and intuitively as possible even if they are only using the tab key to navigate the page. So, we supply anchor links to [let the user skip any redundant page content](http://www.jimthatcher.com/skipnav.htm). In fact, we\u2019ve created a [React component](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/blob/master/client/src/components/global/Utility/SkipLink.js) to do just that. The placement of this anchor link should be immediately before the skippable content.\\n\\n## Glossary\\n\\n### ARIA\\n\\nARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Application and it is generally used to refer to HTML attributes that define how AT treats that element. This behavior can range from what contextual information is read along with the element contents, to the order by which content is traversed, to AT-only after effects to DOM interactions, to providing competing, non-semantic, labels, button text, etc. However, like any newer or more experimental browser feature, care must be taken to avoid using attributes that are not yet fully supported across popular screen readers.\\n\\n### Assistive Technology (AT)\\n\\nAssistive Technology is any type of equipment or system that improves the functional capabilities of those with disabilities. For our purposes, it describes any such technology or software that interfaces or augment a browser-based experience.\\n\\n### Screen Reader\\n\\nA screen reader is a type of AT that uses a text-to-speech (TTS) engine to translate on-screen information into speech, which can be heard through earphones or speakers, or into to braille, with the addition of a refreshable braille display. It is usually a software application native to the computer\u2019s operating system, but [several browsers offer screen reader extensions](http://www.hollier.info/browserpairing/).\\n\\n### Web Accessibility\\n\\nWeb accessibility refers to the inclusive process of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites by people with disabilities. Broadly speaking, the goal is for all users to have equal access to any information and functionality a website might have.\\n\\n### Further Reading\\n\\nOne term I kept coming across in my research was \u201cuniversal design.\u201d Roughly, this is a design approach predicated on creating products, environments, content, etc. that is inherently accessible to everyone and anyone.

Publishers, and any group wanting to publish open-access works on the web, can quickly and easily turn existing files into online publications, through a robust ingestion system that can import texts from EPUB, HTML, Markdown, and Google Doc source files. Authors, working with their publisher, can easily enhance their projects with primary research documents and data, audio and video, links to archives, while engaging with readers and integrating social media conversations. Manifold also enables an iterative approach to publication so that authors can choose to share their work-in-progress as it develops.\\n\\nDoug Armato, Director of the University of Minnesota Press, says, \u201cA goal of Manifold is to maintain professional scholarly publishing at the center of the emerging digital environment. We needed a scalable solution for media-rich monographs, social reading, faster digital publication, iterative and collaborative research and writing methods, as well as interoperability with digital humanities projects. We built Manifold with an eye toward the future when more and more scholars who publish print books will also want them to live, and be interacted with, on the internet.\u201d\\n\\nManifold is a mobile-friendly application that is compatible with all modern devices\u2014smartphones, tablets, notebooks, and desktops. Readers have a beautiful, deep reading experience that encourages discussion and fosters community with the integration of social media.\\n\\nFour major beta versions of Manifold have been released to the public since development of the platform began in April 2015, culminating in Release 1.0 this week. Those wanting to install Manifold can find it at manifoldapp.org.\\n\\nDuring the three-year project, the Manifold team has spoken with university presses, institutes and centers, library publishing groups, and individual scholars, all who can use Manifold to publish the content produced by their group.

Mellon Foundation to launch phase two of Manifold Scholarship, an open-source web-based publishing platform that integrates the publication of media-rich, networked monographs into existing university press publication workflows. With this grant the Manifold Scholarship project will focus on assisting with installations at other institutions, further development of platform features, and a research project about potential OER (open education resources) uses of the platform.\\n\\nUniversity of Minnesota President Eric Kaler says, \u201cWe take great pride in our press\u2019s strong commitment to innovation and its productive, long-term partnership with such a leading digital humanities center as the GC Digital Scholarship Lab at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. The results thus far have been impressive. That so many other presses and scholarly publishing venues at other institutions have expressed an active interest in adopting Manifold confirms our sense of the platform\u2019s significant promise.\u201d\\n\\nIn May 2018, the Manifold partners will issue a call for applications from presses and institutions wanting assistance with getting started in using the Manifold platform. 20 (twenty) groups\u201410 in 2018, and 10 in 2019\u2014will be selected by to receive free installation support and free on-site training to assist them in getting started using the platform.\\n\\nDoug Armato, University of Minnesota Press Director and Co-PI on the grant, says, \u201cWe are excited to have this opportunity to help other university presses, library publishing groups, and university centers install and get started in using the Manifold platform as part of their work to publish scholarship on the web. Working with twenty groups will allow the Manifold team to better understand the goals and needs of publishers who install the platform, and incorporate that feedback in our planning for Manifold\u2019s future development.\u201d\\n\\nOther priorities of Manifold\u2019s phase two grant are enriching the reading experience for users of assistive technology, expanding the platform\u2019s interoperability with other platforms, and a CUNY-led research project focused on open education resources (OER) uses of the platform.\\n\\nMatthew K. Gold, Associate Professor of English and Digital Humanities at The Graduate Center, CUNY and Co-PI on the grant, says, \u201cManifold has the potential to be a powerful platform for open digital pedagogy, allowing groups of students and faculty members to collaboratively read and annotate multimodal texts. OER initiatives have the potential to drive down textbook costs for students and we are particularly excited to work with Minnesota and CUNY librarians as we explore such uses for Manifold.\u201d\\n\\nDevelopment of Manifold Scholarship began in April 2015 culminating in Release 1.0 in March 2018. Publishers, and any group wanting to publish open-access works on the web, can quickly and easily turn existing files into online publications, through a robust ingestion system that can import texts from EPUB, HTML, Markdown, and Google Doc source files.\\n\\nAbout the platform: [https://manifoldapp.org](https://manifoldapp.org)\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/249096229?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\\" width=\\"640\\" height=\\"360\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen=\\"allowfullscreen\\"></iframe>"},{"id":"howtocodeinpythonusingmanifoldtodeliveranopeneducationalresource","metadata":{"permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/howtocodeinpythonusingmanifoldtodeliveranopeneducationalresource","source":"@site/blog/2018-03-08-how-to-code-in-python-using-manifold-to-deliver-an-open-educational-resource.md","title":"How To Code in Python: Using Manifold to Deliver an Open Educational Resource","description":"Recently, my eBook on Python programming, How To Code in Python 3, was made available as a Manifold publication.

When I shifted trajectories to work in the technology industry while completing my PhD, it was important for me to continue to do work that contributed to the public good. What appealed to me about the cloud infrastructure provider DigitalOcean was that it was deeply committed to open source software development and knowledge sharing. I joined the Community team to help write and maintain their large archive of agnostic Creative Commons-licensed and open access technical tutorials that anyone could use to learn about programming and cloud infrastructure.\\n\\nWhen I joined the team, I worked exclusively on developing tutorials on the Python programming language. My efforts were largely based on my pedagogy training that focused on student-centered learning, my research with the CUNY Graduate Center\u2019s [Futures Initiative](https://futuresinitiative.org/), and my own time as a university teacher. I designed a curriculum through learning Python\u2019s logic and code syntax and worked with software developers and product designers in order to present the tutorial pathway in a way that could empower readers. Alongside this work, I produced project-based tutorials to guide readers through creating full working programs, and also worked with external community authors, including former academic colleagues and students like [Michelle Morales](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/users/michellemorales) and [Jeremy Morris](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/users/jeremylevanmorris), to build out this resource.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/03/Django_development.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"Python Development\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nAlthough I designed these tutorials as something that could be read linearly if the reader chose to do so, I wanted to create pathways through the text that could encourage student-driven learning while also providing reference material for more experienced developers. When my team decided to package this material into a [_How To Code in Python_ eBook](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/digitalocean-ebook-how-to-code-in-python) during an organization-wide hackathon, I thought that a book format may actually be somewhat counter-intuitive to my original intentions as it created a more sequential structure that was not as interactive as the tutorial series. This is why, when Matt Gold reached out to me regarding a publication of the book on [CUNY\u2019s instance of Manifold](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/), I was excited about the possibilities.\\n\\nOne of my earliest experiences with interactive online texts was Matt Gold\u2019s own digital editions of [_Debates in the Digital Humanities_](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/). The opportunities afforded through making a fully online and open access version of the text and fostering the exchange of ideas speaks to the positive social impact that is possible through leveraging technology in community-driven ways. This is an especially significant gesture in the field of Digital Humanities, as inviting more people to the discussion can ensure that more communities are given access to not only engaging in the discourse, but to contribute to it as stakeholders.\\n\\nManifold, an open source software project itself, is a platform that can contribute to several communities. As a publishing platform for academic material, it can bridge together scholars across disciplines as they create marginalia that opens broader discussions. It can also be used in the classroom and can be limited in scope so that a book used in a class can be made available only to enrolled students so that they can concentrate and learn together. Finally, platforms like Manifold can work to disrupt silos that prevent communication and understanding between academia and the larger public, by making scholarship more widely available and allowing more to enter the discourse.\\n\\n\u2014 Lisa Tagliaferri ([@lisaironcutter](https://twitter.com/lisaironcutter))"},{"id":"manifoldv040","metadata":{"permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/manifoldv040","source":"@site/blog/2018-01-30-manifold-v0-4-0.md","title":"Manifold v0.4.0","description":"I\'m excited to announce that we\'re releasing v0.4.0 of Manifold today!

I\'m excited to announce that we have wrapped up development on [version 0.3.0 of Manifold Scholarship](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/tree/v0.3.0). This version has been four months in the making, and includes a number of new features and bug fixes. As we move toward a stable 1.0.0 release, our focus has been on improving Manifold\'s performance and stability, and to that end we\'ve managed to pack 85 documented bug fixes into this version. Our work on this release was heavily influenced by the university presses and academic centers who have expressed interest in Manifold, and for whom we\'ve set up instances of Manifold on Google\'s cloud infrastructure. The feedback we\'ve received from these groups around what they\'re looking for in a platform like Manifold has been invaluable, and has guided many of our development choices. Many of the new features\u2014making project pages more customizable, providing content management functionality, improvements to our EPUB ingestion process, draft projects, and improved open graph tagging\u2014are intended to speak to other presses\' need to customize Manifold and make it their own.\\n\\nIn addition to the [230 commits](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0)we\'ve made since [v0.2.0](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/tree/v0.2.0), we\'ve also been working behind the scenes on making it easier for interested groups to try out Manifold. We\'re close to completion on a MacOS package installer (.pkg) for Manifold that will allow developers, scholars, and presses to run a Manifold instance locally on their Mac desktop or laptop (primarily for evaluation purposes). Soon thereafter, we\'ll be releasing Ubuntu packages (.deb), which will make installing Manifold as simple as setting up a VM (on Google Cloud, Digital Ocean, etc) and running a few apt-get commands. We expect to release these installers by the end of October. Before the end of 2017, we plan on providing docker images for those of you who prefer containers. While Manifold is a complex application, with a number of distinct services and underlying dependencies, we\'re committed to finding a reasonably straight-forward way for people to install Manifold.\\n\\nWe\'ve also been making headway on a Manifold informational site, which will soon be live at [manifoldapp.org](http://manifoldapp.org/coming-soon). This site will incorporate high-level information about Manifold, feature lists, community resources, installation instructions, documentation, and more. Keep an eye on [manifoldapp.org](http://manifoldapp.org), and check back in early November.\\n\\nIn preparation for this release, we\'ve reorganized things a bit. For a live demo of the manifold frontend and reading experience, please visit [demo.manifoldapp.org](https://demo.manifoldapp.org). We\'ve loaded up a number of public domain EPUBs from the [Standard Ebooks project](https://standardebooks.org/) to serve as examples. To see how an university press is using Manifold, I\'d encourage you to visit the University of Minnesota Press\' Manifold instance at [manifold.umn.edu](https://manifold.umn.edu). If you\'re interested in learning more about Manifold or having access to a private demo instance for your press, please [reach out to us through our contact form](http://blog.manifoldapp.org/contact/).\\n\\nFinally, if you\'re interested in Manifold and would like to support its development, please star our project on Github.  It only takes a minute, and it really helps raise our profile and attract attention. The more people watching, contributing, and talking about Manifold, the easier it is to maintain our momentum and continue building this tool.\\n\\nWithout further ado, here is an somewhat truncated list of changes for version 0.3.0 of Manifold Scholarship.

After many meetings and planning discussions, and following 1300+ commits to [our public code repository](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold), the initial version of the platform is ready for review. On the beta site, you will find a selection of projects from the University of Minnesota Press that may be read, annotated, highlighted, and shared through social media. These include two recently published full-length scholarly books, a selection from the [Forerunners: Ideas First](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/series/forerunners-ideas-first) series, and four projects just beginning to take shape on the platform:\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Published Books\\n\\n- [The Perversity of Things: Hugo Gernsback on Media, Tinkering, and Scientification](https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/the-perversity-of-things) by Hugo Gernsback.

Images that were part of the print version will appear in-line; resources that have been added for the Manifold edition will appear to the left of the text. Texts are responsive and may be read on any device, though the mobile versions are not yet fully featured. Please note that while we will make an effort to retain annotations and highlights left on the beta platform, we cannot guarantee their preservation.Though the beta version only includes Minnesota publications, the platform is being designed so that any press or interested scholar can install Manifold, customize the platform with specific colors and logos, and publish work through the administrative dashboard. Manifold is capable of ingesting a variety of formats\u2014ePub, HTML, Google Docs, Markdown, Microsoft Word\u2014immediately transforming them into interactive web publications.Manifold is proud to be an open-source project.

In addition to providing access to the reading interface and allowing readers to add projects to their reading lists, each project page links you to the Press\u2019s print book, the project\u2019s social media, and supplemental material.\\n\\n## Reading\\n\\nThe interface is made for readability and usability. You can change colors for higher-contrast, and adjust the margins of the text:\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2017/03/typograhy-view_optimized.gif\').default}\\n    alt=\\"typograhy-view_optimized\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nOr adjust the typography.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2017/03/typography-font_optimized-1.gif\').default}\\n    alt=\\"typography-font_optimized\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\\n</figure>   \\n\\nWhile reading a text, you also have the option to access supplementary materials and annotate both the text and ancillary materials, as well as add comments to other reader\'s annotations that haven\'t been made private. When you select text, a menu pops up with options for highlighting, annotation, citing, and sharing.\\n\\n## Annotating\\n\\nYou have the opportunity to comment on text in the reader interface right in your browser. While designing the platform, the Manifold team considered the expectations scholars have of digital texts.

Our goal is to create a platform that will rival the reading experience of a commercial site like Medium but that is free and open-source. I\u2019m excited to see how various people will use it\u2014certainly our primary audience of university presses, but also a wider set of authors and publishers of all types.\\n\\n**Cool. That sounds like a pretty noble mission to me.**\\n\\nI\u2019m also excited about our team\u2014we have the University of Minnesota Press, which is doing exciting experimentation on both its editorial and production sides\u2014it\u2019s a Press that\u2019s willing to take risks with the way it thinks about the future of publishing. Working with a partner like that\u2014and with Doug Armato and his team in particular\u2014is a lot of fun. And then we are lucky to be collaborating with Cast Iron Coding\u2014Zach Davis and his team are extremely talented and very much aware of the latest trends in web development. Manifold won\u2019t feel like a typical piece of academic technology, thanks to the work of Zach and his team.\\n\\n**What\u2019s your ideal reading experience?**\\n\\nFor me, print is still most important as a reading experience. But I\u2019m never satisfied when I buy a printed book from a bookstore and then \u201cthat\u2019s it.\u201d I can\u2019t carry all of my books with me when I go on a trip, so I really want both print and digital at the point of purchase. For me, if I\u2019m going to read a book of theory or criticism, I\u2019m going to be reading it in print, but I also want to be able to easily pull it up on my laptop or phone when I\u2019m traveling or just happen to think of it during a meeting with a student, or I\u2019m doing some writing and I want to refer to it. I want the materiality of the print book, but for access and reference, the online version. And Manifold is precisely about achieving that hybrid experience. So we are producing print books, but we are also creating web-based interactive texts that open up new collective and social reading experiences.\\n\\n**What are you reading now?**\\n\\nI am reading (and loving) [Barbarian Days by William Finnegan](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/books/review/barbarian-days-a-surfing-life-by-william-finnegan.html?_r=0). Somehow, reading about waves feels like the right thing in this post-election moment\u2014an escape from politics but also a reminder of how to make our way among larger and sometimes brutal forces. **Who inspires your work? ** I tend to be inspired by my academic mentors. My first academic mentor was Robert D. Richardson, Jr., who is a biographer of Thoreau and Emerson (his [biography of Emerson](http://www.robertdrichardson.com/books/emerson-the-mind-on-fire/) remains one of my favorite books). I\u2019m still in awe of his erudition and research and writing skills. I\u2019m also inspired on a daily level by my colleagues at the Graduate Center and across CUNY, especially by the students I work with.\\n\\n***\\n\\nAfter Matt answered all the questions, we had the chance to speak more broadly about Manifold and the features that specifically address readers\u2019 needs. The design of the platform\u2014from the icons, to commenting and annotation, to the reading interface\u2014is the result of careful consideration by a team of careful readers. Moving forward, even as I share more about the creators of Manifold and the reading practices that influence its development, I will be adding a features series to outline the thinking that goes into the various components of Manifold."},{"id":"readingwithzachdavis","metadata":{"permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/readingwithzachdavis","source":"@site/blog/2016-12-05-reading-with-zach-davis.md","title":"Reading with Zach Davis","description":"Last week, calling Portland from the Digital Scholarship Lab at the Graduate Center, I had the pleasure of speaking with Manifold\u2019s lead developer, Zach Davis at Cast Iron Coding.

Yet again, my attempts to record the call came to naught, but I will conjure some of the conversation from my notes.\\n\\nZach is Principal Chief Technologist at Cast Iron Coding. His previous CIC projects include sites for the [Hammer Museum](http://castironcoding.com/work/hammer) in Los Angeles, [The Edna McConnell Clark Foundation](http://www.emcf.org/), the [Jersey Give-Back Guide](https://jerseygivebackguide.org/) (check out the animation on the \u201cgenerosity generator\u201d) and [Debates in Digital Humanities](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/), a collaboration with The University of Minnesota Press and Matt Gold that served as a prototype for the Manifold project.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nZach has been working steadily and seems rejuvenated by the team\'s recent Portland meeting. Talking through the [next steps and considerations](http://manifold.umn.edu/2016/11/18/this-week-in-manifold-team-meeting-numerous-fixes/) about how university presses will be able to customize Manifold installations seems to have crystallized the work that everyone has been doing in exciting ways.\\n\\nFirst, I asked Zach what matters most to him about Manifold. He noted the two most important things to him at this stage, made even more clear after the meeting.\\n\\n1. That Manifold is open and open source. Zach says, \u201cit is a pleasure to work on software that _has_ to be open source, where it\u2019s written into the very project.\u201d\\n2. That they are building something that solves a problem for a good number of people. He recognizes the audience, but beyond Manifold\u2019s immediate uses for the press, the software has the potential to serve an even wider segment.\\n\\nAfter that we spoke about ideal reading experiences. While his habits have changed since the days when he was a Ph.D. student in English at the CUNY Graduate Center, Zach says it\u2019s \\"still a book most of the time. It depends on what kind of text. I don\u2019t read theory and criticism the way I used to. For short forms, I will read on the web or my phone, but for reading, I still like the physical artifact.\u201d We talked a bit about the different demands of different types of reading. When he was working on his dissertation, Zach categorized himself as a transcriber. He would cite passages as a way of thinking through the content. Now while working on Manifold, he imagines the sort of tools that would have facilitated this sort of reading. He says he also spent much of his academic life reading digital texts, which were often easier to track down. He thinks about the ways Manifold could simplify the lives of scholars.\\n\\nWhat is he reading right now?\\n\\n1. A collection of Leonard Cohen poetry\\n2. Margaret Atwood\u2019s _The Handmaid\u2019s Tale_\\n\\nBoth seem rather timely.\\n\\nLastly, I asked who inspires his work. Zach says lately he has been particularly inspired by the work of [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov), a JavaScript developer. He finds inspiration in Abramov\u2019s career and particularly appreciates Abramov\u2019s attitude about open source software and towards the community around his work. Now that he has transitioned to his developer role, he finds his book-world inspirations are much the same as they were ten years ago. He says he hopes he in any way resembles the thoughtful, careful, kind approach to work and students that he saw in Milton scholar and mentor [Joseph Wittreich](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/English/Faculty-by-Field/Joseph-Wittreich) at the Graduate Center.\\n\\nAs the project moves on, I\u2019m interested in the ways the underlying experience of the Manifold team influences the way they craft the reading experience.\\n\\nThanks, Zach!\\n\\nFollow [@zdavis](https://twitter.com/zdavis)"},{"id":"thisweekinmanifoldbackend","metadata":{"permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/thisweekinmanifoldbackend","source":"@site/blog/2016-12-05-this-week-in-manifold-backend.md","title":"This Week in Manifold: Markdown and Backend Development","description":"Since I last posted, we\'ve been making development progress on a few different fronts.

Therefore, I\'m going to skip the full list of revisions in this post, and instead offer a high level description of our recent efforts.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Markdown and GitBook Support\\n\\nFundamentally, Manifold has been conceived as a tool for university presses. When it comes to thinking about how it will be used, UMNP has guided our thinking about what problems presses are trying to solve, and how Manifold can help. That said, I think everyone on the project has also been interested in the ways in which Manifold can be a useful tool for the broader academic community. At the very least, we want to make it possible for individuals to find ways to use Manifold. One impediment to this, in my mind, has been the fact that to date Manifold only accepts finished EPUB documents as an input format, and independent scholars and self-publishers may find it difficult to come up with finished EPUBs.\\n\\nEPUBs are essentially packages containing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In a sense, an EPUB is a small, self-contained website, and EPUB readers are offline, limited browsers. HTML, therefore, is already an input format that Manifold understands and can work with. What this means is that any document type that can easily be converted to HTML can likely be consumed by Manifold and made available to readers.\\n\\nWe refer to the process of slurping a book up into Manifold as \\"Ingestion.\\" Manifold can be extended by adding ingestion strategies to it. An ingestion strategy tells Manifold how to map a source document\u2014eg, an EPUB\u2014to a format it can understand. In short, we\'ve anticipated that we\'ll want to ingest other kinds of documents and have left places where other developers can create their own strategies. With the aim of testing out this approach and also furthering our goal of increasing Manifold\'s user base, we spent a couple days writing a Markdown strategy that supports the GitBook format. This means that users will be able to feed Manifold a set of nested Markdown documents, which Manifold will then be able to make available online, just as it does an EPUB. Manifold\'s documentation, for example, is authored following the GitBook format, and it can now be read within Manifold itself. Three cheers for eating our own dog food!\\n\\n## Backend Development\\n\\nSince I last posted, we\'ve also been hard at work at building out the backend interfaces. Most of the basic backend HTML and CSS has been completed, and we\'re now in the process of developing reusable patterns and components in React to wire up the backend forms to the API. This has been challenging, as there is a lot of functionality required in Manifold\'s admin interface, and figuring out how to model the requisite state while keeping in our Flux architecture has required some thinking. We\'re close on this, with some initial proof of concept work, which I\'ll be discussing more in subsequent posts.\\n\\nThat\'s it for today! We\'ll be posting more updates (hopefully with screenshots and some design comps) later this week."},{"id":"thisweekinmanifoldteammeetingnumerousfixes","metadata":{"permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/thisweekinmanifoldteammeetingnumerousfixes","source":"@site/blog/2016-11-18-this-week-in-manifold-team-meeting-numerous-fixes.md","title":"This Week in Manifold: Team meeting, Numerous Fixes","description":"This has been an exciting week for Manifold.

Last week, in the midst of national turmoil, I had the pleasure of interviewing Susan Doerr, University of Minnesota Press Assistant Director, Digital Publishing and Operations. During our phone call, I asked Susan a number of questions about her thoughts on reading and the Manifold platform.\\n\\nI started by asking Susan what matters most to her about Manifold. She talked about the process of collaborating with the Manifold team on writing the grant proposal, and thinking about publishing books in the browser. Susan believes the real revolution of an epub or pdf ebook is the speed of distribution\u2014instant access for a reader. Susan said, \u201cebook reading devices are siloed\u2014a reader is stuck in an app or device.\u201d What the Manifold team wanted to do was \u201cbreak free from that constraint. Ebooks today are replications of print\u2014active media that don\'t do much more than the print edition of a book. And we wanted to do more.\u201d\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nPublishing a book in the browser allows it to be dynamic\u2014vs static. The more they thought about it, the more opportunity they saw for readers to follow a project as it evolve because Manifold can publish a project iteratively, that is, in pieces over time.\\n\\n> We could transform the process of how the author might publish. We started our work with definitions: What is a version? What is an iteration? What is a resource? We broke from the word \\"book\\" and moved to the broader term \u201cproject,\u201d which we define as a work that is a combination of texts and resources.\\n\\nSusan noted that other publishing tools offer these features\u2014but Manifold also aims to \u201ccreate an efficient workflow process available to be replicated by other publishers.\u201d\\n\\nNext I asked, what\'s your ideal reading experience? This one took a moment. Susan said she had no single answer. It all depends on \u201cWhat is it that you\'re reading for? Why are you coming to the text?\u201d For leisure reading, Susan reads paperbacks or on her ebook reader. Reading for work, though\u2014she\u2019s a note taker\u2014means reading reading parts of a work over time and marking up a text. Her reading demands \u201cdifferent interactions depending on why I\u2019m reading this text. Reading for information, you want the apparatus for notes and asking questions and linking to other pieces.\u201d For her, when reading for escapism she wants to lose herself in the story. Manifold is not meant to serve all the reasons you read, rather \u201cit is addressing something specific. It\u2019s not meant to be a panacea of all publishing.\u201d Susan went on,\\n\\n> Print is a funny thing\u2014we\'re used to it historically being the solution for sharing and distributing published work. The book object\u2014front cover, open it and read, turn the page, is familiar, and that medium for a mode of expressing text and images to share information is really sophisticated\u2014it evolved over hundreds of years. Manifold is a baby\u2014we\u2019re developing its first version. A book, the object, meets so many needs\u2014and we\'ve had years to adapt it to meet so many needs\u2014it feels perfect, but it may just be familiar.\\n\\nWhen asked what she is reading now, Susan described a reading practice that spans formats. The books she reads circle around subjects she never studied in school, such as medieval central Asia. She is currently reading [Empires of the Silk Road](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8882.html), by Christopher Beckwith, after finishing [The Lost Enlightenment](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10064.html) by S. Frederick Starr and Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World by Adrienne Mayor. She also listens to audiobooks of cultural histories while she paints; she just finished [The Art of Rivalry](http://www.audible.com/pd/Arts-Entertainment/The-Art-of-Rivalry-Audiobook/B01LZUIZIK?mkwid=DSATitle_dc&pcrid=158258695650&pmt=b&pkw=_intitle%3Aaudiobook&source_code=GO1GB907OSH060513&cvosrc=ppc%20dynamic%20search.google.97175169&cvo_crid=158258695650&cvo_pid=5075902449&gclid=CNqDirb1n9ACFZpMDQodOtcCIg) by Sebastian Smee, which she found after enjoying [In Montmartre: Picasso, Matisse and Modernism in Paris 1900-1910,](http://www.audiobooks.com/audiobook/in-montmartre/230383)by Susan Roe. On her ebook reader, she says she reads mostly fiction\u2014recently N. K. Jemisin\u2019s The [Obelisk Gate](http://www.npr.org/2016/08/18/489497592/riveting-obelisk-gate-shatters-the-stillness).\\n\\nFor the last question\u2014who inspires your work?\u2014Susan had quite an inspiring list.\\n- _Other university presses_. She mentioned frontrunner work of National Academies Press. She follows publishing evolution\u2014how they are adapting practices, not just around issues of open access.

When last Friday rolled around, we had a number of updates ready to go out to our staging site. However, when it was time to deploy, we hit a few unexpected problems.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## DevOps, Hosting Manifold, and Deployment\\n\\nThis release adds a new metadata field to projects. Because the exact metadata requirements are difficult to pin down and may change from press to press, we wanted a relatively flexible approach to storing project, text, and resource metadata. Back in the day, we might have used an [EAV model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model) for this, but there are many well-documented drawbacks to that model. Because Manifold uses PostgreSQL as its database backend, we have access to a variety of field types for storing arbitrary amounts of data. In the past, we\'ve used [HSTORE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/hstore.html) for storing key/value pairs, but in this case we wanted something more flexible that could store different data types (HSTORE stores strings, but we want to store integers, boolean values, strings, arrays, etc). Recent versions of PostgreSQL include the JSONB field type, which is exactly what we want in this case.\\n\\nAlas, that meant that the October 28th release required some infrastructure updates. Sure, we could have shelled into the staging server and done a quick upgrade, but that\'s not how we roll on this project. It\'s really important to us that it be possible to easily provision hosts for Manifold, which means automating as much as possible. As Manifold grows, it relies on more and more services to run, which makes setting it up increasingly complex. With this release, Manifold needs all of the following configured on the server to run correctly:\\n\\n- Ruby 2.3 (for the API)\\n- Node 4.5 or higher (for the client)\\n- Postgres 9.4 or higher (for storage)\\n- Redis (for queuing background jobs)\\n- ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick (for resizing images)\\n- Nginx or Apache (for serving the API and the Client)\\n\\nMoreover, in addition to having all these requirements in place, the server also requires that a number of background processes are always running. As of right now, there are four custom services (excluding the webserver and the database server) that need to be running on the host: 1) manifold\\\\_api (Rails app served by [Puma](http://puma.io/)), 2) manifold\\\\_client (Node app), 3) manifold\\\\_scheduler (Ruby daemon), and 4) manifold\\\\_workers ([Sidekiq](http://sidekiq.org/)). Keeping four services running on a server (or on multiple servers) is not without its complexities. If we run these on Ubuntu Trusty (v14), for example, we need Upstart scripts that manage the services. If we run Manifold on Ubuntu Xenial (v16), then we\'re going to need Systemd scripts. If it runs on older versions of Centos or Redhat, then we\'ll probably need some init.d scripts.\\n\\nRunning a complex app with separate parts is tricky. Internally at Cast Iron, we use [puppet](https://puppet.com/) and [foreman](https://theforeman.org/) to manage these services. Needing to support Postgres 9.4 got us thinking about deploying Manifold to Ubuntu Xenial, which in turn led us to revisit our manifests. Once we went to Xenial, we had to rewrite our startup scripts for systemd, which in turn revealed problems with how we were storing secrets in the environment. In short, instead of spending the last week working on project resources and feature development, we spent it paying down some technical debt on the infrastructure side, and improving Manifold\'s devOps and stability.\\n\\nThat\'s done now, and we\'re deploying Manifold to Xenial and fully managing its environment and all dependencies via Puppet. Revisiting this infrastructure has also given us an opportunity to reflect further on Manifold\'s installation story and continue discussions about how we can make Manifold easy for other presses to adopt and install.\\n\\n## New Features\\n\\nWe did manage to slip a few important features into this week\'s release. The full list is below, but there\'s one in particular I want to highlight.\\n\\nThis release includes a scheduler that runs constantly in the background while Manifold is running. One of the things this scheduler does is trigger a background job for fetching tweets related to projects in Manifold. That job currently runs hourly.\\n\\nEditors can use twitter search terms to describe what kind of tweets Manifold should pull in for a given project. This gives editors quite a bit of flexibility. For example, Manifold might watch the author\'s twitter account for all tweets with a specific hash tag. Or, it might watch twitter in general for all tweets that include a given hashtag. Our tweet fetching service accepts multiple search terms, so it\'s possible for a project to follow multiple accounts and hashtags.\\n\\nThese tweets show up on the project activity feed. Readers can browse through the historical activity for a project and see the events\u2014texts being added, tweets about the project, new resources uploaded\u2014that took place as the project became a published book (see screenshot, below). Our hope is that showing this activity helps make public the iterative aspects of authorship.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img \\n    src={require(\'/img/blog/legacy_wp/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-04-at-9.58.24-AM.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"Project Activity\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nWell, that\'s enough for today.

I believe that the many ways we read books should be simultaneously available and that ideas deserve the full range of available outlets and expression.

Once that happens, it will be possible for readers of this blog to check out our weekly builds for themselves. Our last development sprint focused on tightening up existing code, mainly around the project detail view. Notable changes included the following:\\n\\n## Refactoring\\n\\n- Refactored login overlay CSS for improved reusability\\n- Refactored the authentication [reducer](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html)\\n- Significantly reorganized client frontend components for easier readability and reusability\\n\\n## Features and Improvements\\n\\n- Exposed \\"published\\" boolean attribute on Texts in the API\\n- Stubbed markup and styles for the resource collection detail component\\n- Stubbed markup and styles for the collection list component\\n- Stubbed markup and styles for the resource list component\\n- Improved client application exception handling\\n- Upgraded [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) to [15.4.0-RC3](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/v15.4.0-rc.3)\\n- Implemented project importer that imports projects, texts, and resources from json manifest\\n- Expanded project API to expose all data shown in the comps\\n- Adjusted component to show project creator names below project thumbnails\\n- Adjusted component to show actual project dates below project thumbnails\\n- Stubbed markup and styles for project events (on project detail, and stand-alone), aka activity\\n- Added mobile styles for event lists\\n- Added metadata [JSONB field type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/datatype-json.html) to projects and expose via API\\n- Implemented actual project metadata in the project detail component\\n\\n## Tooling and Libraries\\n\\n- Switched Manifold client testing framework to [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)\\n- Updated all client NPM modules\\n- [DRY\'d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) up client application [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) configuration\\n- Reorganized and improved build and server scripts for client application\\n- Improved API application [Puma](http://puma.io/) configuration\\n- Switched client from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic dependency resolution (and speed)\\n- Removed [redux-devtools component](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools); replace with [similar Chrome extension](http://zalmoxisus.github.io/redux-devtools-extension/)\\n- Added [moment](http://momentjs.com/) module for handling dates and times\\n- Updated global and API Rubies to version 2.3.1\\n\\n## Bug Fixes\\n\\n- Corrected login overlay view state\\n- Removed randomness from stubbed resource components (breaks universal rendering)\\n- Added code to prevent client application from requesting \\"page\\" entities on every route change\\n\\nIn addition to these changes, the Manifold team also touched base last week during our recurring (bi-monthly) meeting. The group discussed text and project metadata requirements, the overall project roadmap, the agenda for our in-person Portland meeting in mid-November, among other things. Joining that call for the first time was [Jojo Karlin](https://twitter.com/jojokarlin), a Doctoral student in English at the CUNY Graduate Center who is working with [Matt Gold](https://twitter.com/mkgold) on this project.

For other presses, third-party service providers, or packagers, handle the creation of electronic editions in parallel with print or as an afterthought to it. That is to say, even when print isn\u2019t to be the only medium of publication, it still receives primacy over all other editions. When a question of formatting comes up, it\u2019s a question to be resolved for print first. When internal elements are being scrutinized, they are done through a lens that foremost anticipates a static physical object.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve reached a moment, however, when we need to step back from print and see it in the proper context among the myriad means of expression scholars now have at their disposal. And it\u2019s time to grapple with the fact that scholarly publishing involves more than books, more than journals, more than print. It\u2019s not tied to paper; it\u2019s not a function of the software it passes through. Instead, it\u2019s the expression of content in the most meaningful and impactful ways possible. In that context, university presses must become adaptive and able to treat materials that aren\u2019t always easily categorized or codified just as well as they do traditional vehicles like a journal or monograph.\\n\\nThat is no small thing. The print paradigm has been refined and honed for generations. It is deeply ingrained, predicating the workings of every department within a press. Reengineering it is not something that will happen overnight. Nor should it. But nor should we let the print mold stand as a boulder, cordoning off those modes of expression that weren\u2019t possible a few years ago or those just over the horizon.\\n\\nExploring those opportunities is the commitment of the Manifold team. We bring together the perspectives of the university press, the scholar, and the technologist to hone in on new ways presses can present scholarship, realistically adapt existing procedures to account for a broad spectrum of publishing output, and technically deliver those varied means of expression to the readership in ways they are expecting as well as in ways they are not.\\n\\nAs the Manifold digital projects editor, I am working closely with the platform developers at [Cast Iron Coding](http://castironcoding.com/), our partners at the [GC Digital Scholarship Lab](http://gcdsl.commons.gc.cuny.edu/), authors, and press staff across departments here at Minnesota to help craft, test, and document replicable processes that will allow presses to shift from a publishing plan with a very specific terminus to one that celebrates projects as a spectrum of scholarly publication. In the weeks and months ahead, I\u2019ll be returning here to talk more about the implications of that and the challenges we\u2019re working through as we move from platform wireframes into more robust test cases.\\n\\nStay tuned.

The fixed form of the book, for example, doesn\u2019t reflect the long duration of research, the months of ethnography, the full compliment of data collection and archival deep-dives. The monograph doesn\u2019t record the full chorus of voices that help shape a project, such as the feedback of colleagues and peers. Research is already iterative, benefitting from community dialogue and from interfacing with an array of media. It\u2019s just that the current way of disseminating that research doesn\u2019t reflect those pre-publication engagements.\\n\\nUp to now, when authors have wanted to share with readers materials that can\u2019t fit into a print book such as audio and video files, teaching tools, or archival materials, they have often had to host them on a disconnected website. There\u2019s often little travel between the website and the physical book, and these websites quickly fade away, disconnected by link rot or taken down from university servers when a scholar switches institutions. But these objects are never ancillary\u2014they are part and parcel of the work itself. One potential Manifold author remarked to me that the traditional book doesn\u2019t offer readers the chance to review the primary materials and say, \u201cI disagree.\u201d Manifold will allow authors to embed these objects within or alongside the text so that readers can chart their own course through all the elements that make up a scholarly book and research project.\\n\\nThis feature is especially important to Manifold author Mara Mills, assistant professor of media, culture and communication at New York University. Mills was initially attracted to Manifold because it provided an opportunity to develop an accessible multimedia publication:\\n\\n> My manuscript-in-progress,\u201cPrint Disability and New Reading Formats,\u201d examines the century-long history of electronic reading by those excluded from the inkprint book. The research for this project has involved the digital transfer of hundreds of historical sound recordings: shellac Talking Book records; open reel tapes of early text-to-tone and text-to-speech reading machine output; demonstration cassettes of early time stretching technology for \u201cspeed listening\u201d; recordings of audio-described films and graphic novels. My book, about multimodal reading and the multiplicity of \u201cthe book,\u201d simply cannot exist in inkprint format alone.\\n\\nOften, authors finish a book project that distills hours of audio interviews into a handful of block quotes, or a gallery of scanned images from which they draw fifteen or twenty to produce in black and white on the printed page. The traditional monograph doesn\u2019t always account for the labor of discovery and archiving that is a part of research. When copyright and ethics allow, authors will be able to share these archives with readers through Manifold.\\n\\nStephanie Boluk and Patrick Lemieux are currently authoring their first book, tentatively titled \u201cMetgaming: Videogames and the Practice of Play,\u201d which studies a critical practice and form of game design philosophy in which playing games, making games, and thinking about games occur simultaneously. The Manifold edition of their book will include original, playable games designed by the authors, but they also see the Manifold project as archiving a genre of media which is often elusive:\\n\\n> Given the kinds of practice-based research both documented and performed in the volume, we\'re very excited to begin \u201cMetagaming\u201d with the Manifold team. Manifold not only offers the possibility to hyperlink to sources outside the text, replace figures with HD video, and embed our original games directly within the text, but could also function as a repository or archive for unique and hard-to-find software discussed and used throughout the book. We also hope Manifold will help to make \u201cMetagaming\u201d more accessible for students by offering additional educational resources like a podcast we are in the process of planning in which we interview metagamers featured in the chapters and 20-min video summaries discussing the content of each chapter.\\n\\nThis willingness to think beyond the book is what acquisitions editors are looking for in Manifold projects. Press director and acquiring editor Doug Armato explains:\\n\\n> With Manifold, I\u2019m looking for publishing projects that can\'t be fully realized in the fixed, single-dimension of the page. This is not just a matter of adding multi-media or live links, but of seeing a scholarly work in its context of a longer research project, making its archive visible and accessible, and enabling the reader feedback and discussion that shape a book\u2019s creation and reception. Not every scholarly author will want to work this way, but some do and I want Manifold to provide a publishing home for them\u2014and one they don\u2019t have to build themselves, as with the authoring tools already out there.\\n\\nWe are developing Manifold to not only expand what can be included within the book, but also to break down the temporal barriers that separate years of research from the book\u2019s publication for authors who want to engage their readers at an early stage, share drafts of chapters in order to try out ideas, and receive feedback and dialogue as a form of open peer review. Danielle Kasprzak is Humanities Editor at the press and also acquires and oversees the press\u2019s Forerunners: Ideas First program, which publishes thoughts-in-process as digital works and as affordable print publications. Forerunners aims to collapse the current publishing timeline to twelve weeks, so timing is often on her mind. Kasprzak is most excited about getting ideas out into the world more quickly than the traditional publication schedules of print books:\\n\\n> Part of the reason why authors are attracted to Forerunners is the speed at which texts are released. I\u2019m pleased that scholars from diverse disciplines have seen publishing their ideas in a speculative, early way as beneficial to their thinking process.\\n\\nMara Mills is also excited by the pre-publication aspects we are building into Manifold. For Mills, this pre-publication aspect of Manifold will be \\"a way to curate my sound materials, write a few introductory provocations, and invite others to think with me about what it means to read.\u201d\\n\\nThis notion of curation is critical to what I am looking for in a Manifold book project. Manifold will track a work as it is conceptualized, researched, written, and read, giving readers access to primary research documents and data, links to related archives, rich media, social media, and reading tools. Taking advantage of these tools, an author will also become a curator, shaping archives, providing context for readers, and illustrating the varied parts that make up her book and larger research project. It will ask authors to collaborate with the press on questions of copyright and ethics, peer review and evaluation, and to consider how best to connect with readers (both within the academy and general readers) in meaningful ways.\\n\\nManifold will recode the very definition of the scholarly monograph. To realize that goal, we are looking for authors whose vision for their scholarly projects extends beyond the limitations of the traditional book.\\n\\n\u2014 Jason Weidemann, Editorial Director"},{"id":"atechnicalintroductiontomanifold","metadata":{"permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/atechnicalintroductiontomanifold","source":"@site/blog/2015-12-03-a-technical-introduction-to-manifold.md","title":"A Technical Introduction to Manifold","description":"Hello Manifoldians!","date":"2015-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":8.71,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"atechnicalintroductiontomanifold","title":"A Technical Introduction to Manifold"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Thoughts from Editors and Authors on What Makes a Good Manifold Project","permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/thoughtsfromeditorsandauthorsonwhatmakesagoodmanifoldproject"},"nextItem":{"title":"Opening Access: The Reinvention of the Academic Book","permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/openingaccessthereinventionoftheacademicbook"}},"content":"Hello Manifoldians!\\n\\nI\'m Zach Davis, principle at [Cast Iron Coding](http://castironcoding.com), a web development studio in Portland, Oregon. My team and I are responsible for UX design, visual design, and development of Manifold over the course of the grant, and it is my hope that I\'ll be able to post regular updates here detailing development and design decisions, challenges, and milestones over the course of the project.\\n\\nFor now, however, I\'d like to walk through the technology stack we\'ve settled on, and the reasoning behind some of these choices. If anyone has any questions, please don\'t hesitate to post a comment!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Where to find the source code\\n\\nAs you know, one of the requirements of the grant funding this development is that Manifold be released as open source, and our current plan is to release Manifold under the GPLv3. For the time being, Manifold source code is stored in the [ManifoldScholar/manifold Github repository](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold). If you look at the [ManifoldScholar GitHub organization](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar), you\'ll see additional repositories for [Manifold-API](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold-api) and [Manifold-Client](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold-client). Eventually, we hope to be able to provide the Manifold API as a stand-alone piece of software that can be used to parse, store, and expose ePub and Markdown documents over a RESTful API. In preparation for this, we\'re using a [git subtree-split strategy](https://medium.com/@porteneuve/mastering-git-subtrees-943d29a798ec#.siwyoulty) to break the Manifold project into separate API and Client packages. These split repositories are updated significantly less frequently than the main Manifold repository. If your goal is to follow our development, for now your best bet will be to just watch the primary repository.\\n\\nWe\'ve already made significant progress on Manifold, although we\'re still far from an alpha release. We\'d love it if you\'d show your support for our project by starring our GitHub repo and keeping an eye on development. As we get closer to a stable alpha release in 2016, we\'ll invite community members to download and install their own instance of Manifold.\\n\\n## Server-side architecture\\n\\nManifold is split into the client application, and the server-side application. For now, these two applications share a repository to simplify development, but they are very distinct and meant to run independently of each other.\\n\\nThe server-side application is built in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). Specifically, we\'re using what is currently edge Rails, and what will soon be [Rails 5](https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/a-look-at-rails-5). The development team thought long and hard about what server-side language to use, which was mainly a debate about the relative merits of using Ruby or Javascript on the server. While we have many years of experience working with PHP, and understand that it is still a popular, easy choice among academic developers, we felt strongly that the advantages of Ruby\u2014strong OOP support, support for more functional styles, cleaner and more consistent syntax, and the maturity of Rails\u2014outweighed the disadvantages of a more complex execution model and smaller (but by no means small) developer community. [Laravel](http://laravel.com/), the current leading PHP framework, for all its notable strengths, lacks the completeness and maturity of Rails and Active Record. Our choice to go with edge rails, rather than stable Rails 4.x, was driven by the fact that our server-side component is [only serving an API](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html), and Rails 5 will eventually ship with an api-only flag. This means that many aspects of Rails\u2014the view layer, sprockets, etc\u2014have been removed, making for a more lightweight framework overall. Another strong reason for choosing Rails was the presence of a strong HTML/XML parsing library in [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org). Manifold deals heavily (but not exclusively) in EPUBs, which are HTML documents. To pull those documents apart and recreate them in the browser, we need a powerful parsing tool, which we\'ve found in [Nokogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org/).\\n\\nThe server side application exposes a REST style API to be consumed by the client. This API conforms to the style and conventions laid out by Steve Klabnik, Yehuda Katz, Dan Gebhardt, Tyler Kellen, and Ethan Resnick in the [JSON API Specification](http://jsonapi.org/). While it\'s important that developers expose all the things with APIs, it\'s challenging when each API follows its own idiosyncratic conventions. One of our goals on this project is to make Manifold as easy as possible to integrate into a presses existing infrastructure and environment, and following an established API specification helps us with that goal. Because the Manifold client application consumed Manifold\'s public API, integrators can be sure that the API is well tested and reliable.\\n\\nAuthentication against the API will be handled using [JSON Web Tokens](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) (JWT). It will also be possible for a user to generate an API token by logging in through an [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) provider such as Twitter or Facebook.\\n\\n## Client-side architecture\\n\\nIf we made a safe, conservative choice in Rails on the server-side, we\'ve taken more of a leap on the client-side. The Manifold client is a [single page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPA) that is built on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/). Both are relatively new Javascript libraries (or frameworks, depending on how you look at things) that are rapidly gaining mindshare and popularity among front-end developers. For those who are unfamiliar, React is a Javascript library that simplifies the process of creating reusable components. Unlike other popular libraries such as [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) or [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/), React does not attempt to solve the problem of two-way data binding. Instead, it is meant to be used with a specific architecture called [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), which is structured around one-way data flow and immutability. Both React and Redux have a relatively small surface area. Redux APIs are small, and the library as a whole is under 15k.\\n\\nAt Cast Iron, we\'ve worked with many Javascript frameworks, in particular Angular and Backbone. Over time, client-side development has become quite complex, and it\'s our feeling that while Angular can work well on some projects, it doesn\'t do enough to reduce that complexity. By restricting the way in which data can flow through the application, and abstracting away the asynchronicity that can make client-side development challenging, we\'ve found Redux and React to be a powerful combination that allows us to iterate quickly without sacrificing quality or maintainability.\\n\\nThere are some challenges that come with developing a single page javascript application. For our purposes, the biggest challenge is to ensure that there is content loaded on the page before the javascript executes. We feel strongly that Manifold needs to be accessible to users with disability, to search engine crawlers, to screen readers, etc, and that we can\'t count on a javascript environment. For this reason, the Manifold client will be served by a small Node/Express application running on the server. Most of the javascript that executes in the browser is built to be [isomorphic](http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/) (now also known as [universal](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9#.hna9d3dg8)), which means that care has been taken to ensure that it can be executed in a server-side context (node) and in a client-side context (the browser). The practical outcome of this approach is that the server-side component will be able to fully render the HTML before sending the page to the client, which solves the many accessibility and SEO problems.\\n\\nThe advantages to the SPA approach are, well, manifold. The application will feel very fast, and we\'ll be vastly reducing the amount of data that\'s sent over the network. Complex UI elements, like the annotation pieces, will be have a much more stable, testable framework backing them. There will be more room for reusable components, and the various state-changes that can occur in the client-side application will be well tested.\\n\\nWhile we\'re diving in head-first on React + Redux, we are not, for now, following the current trend of doing only inline-CSS. For the time being, we\'ll be using the SASS preprocessor for all styles.\\n\\nAt the language level, we\'re relying heavily on ES6 and upcoming ES7 features. We\'re using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile ES6+ code down to ES5  so that it will run in IE9+, Firefox, and Safari. By using edge Javascript language features, our hope is that to some degree we will future proof Manifold code. For now, we\'re limiting ourselves to [ES6+ features that are at stage 1 or greater](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/blob/master/README.md), and acknowledge that there is some risk even with stage 1.\\n\\nWe rely heavily on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) for package management, and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for transpiling assets during development, and for building assets for production. At Cast Iron, we\'ve used Grunt and Gulp on other projects, but it looks to us like the React community is gravitating toward Webpack, and for good reasons. On Manifold, it\'s being used for automatically linting our code, for generating icon fonts from SVG icons, for transpiling ES6+ to ES5, and Sass to CSS.\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nTests are important. They build confidence and help us to refactor without regressions. While we don\'t always follow test-driven-development practices, we do feel that it\'s important to have a robust test suite in place. On the API side, we\'re using [rspec](http://rspec.info/) for tests. On the client-side we will be using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).\\n\\n## Server infrastructure and continuous integration\\n\\nDevOps and infrastructure automation are essential to our workflow at Cast Iron. We use [Boxen](https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/#our-boxen) to setup development instances of projects, and we use [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/) to deploy applications to staging and production environments. Our manifests for deploying Manifold are still in progress, but they\'re close. Soon, I hope to have a staging environment that\'s updated regularly via [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/), our continuous integration server. Soon, we\'ll also have Travis build notifications in place on the Github repository.\\n\\nTo run Manifold, you\'ll need to have the following setup on a server:\\n\\n- Nginx for serving the Ruby app and the Node app\\n- Puma for serving Manifold API (although you could use Unicorn or another app server)\\n- Ruby 2.2.x\\n- Postgres for the API database\\n- A recent version of Node\\n- Eventually, I expect you\'ll need Elastic Search for the search component\\n\\nWe\'ll be providing instructions on how to set this up, as well as sample config files. Eventually, I hope to provide apt-get packages for Ubuntu as well. Once things are a bit more stable, we\'ll regularly release docker containers that you can use to take Manifold for a spin.\\n\\n## In Closing\\n\\nHopefully this gives you a better sense of what we\'re using to build Manifold, and why. I\'d love to have a conversation about our choices, so please don\'t hesitate to leave feedback in the comments. In the coming weeks, I\'m going to try to share some early artifacts from the UX and visual design process, to give you a better sense of what Manifold will look like and what it will be capable of."},{"id":"openingaccessthereinventionoftheacademicbook","metadata":{"permalink":"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/openingaccessthereinventionoftheacademicbook","source":"@site/blog/2015-11-12-opening-access-the-reinvention-of-the-academic-book.md","title":"Opening Access: The Reinvention of the Academic Book","description":"On Tuesday, November 10, I was very happy to participate in an online conversation convened by the Association of American University Presses (AAUP) on the topic of \\"Opening Access: The Reinvention of the Academic Book.\\" During the session, which was moderated by Jennifer Howard of the Chronicle of Higher Education, I discussed the Manifold Scholarship project and issues related to digital monographs with my fellow panelists Frances Pinter (Manchester University Press/Knowledge Unlatched), Peter Suber (Harvard University Berkman Center for Internet & Society), and Augusta Rohrbach (author of Thinking Outside the Book).

The creation of Manifold, an intuitive, collaborative, open-source platform for scholarly works. With iterative texts, powerful annotation tools, rich media support, and robust community dialogue, Manifold will transform scholarly publications into living digital works.\\n2. Rethinking the print-focused mode of scholarly authorship and university press editorial procedures and production workflows to accommodate the differences in creating content for iterative, networked publication.\\n\\n## Creating Manifold\\nOver the past decade, university presses have made substantial progress toward the first phase of making scholarly books digital\u2014converting monographs into pdf and epub editions. This has been enabled by the compatibility of current publishing practice and scholarly publishing economics with these fixed formats\u2014formats that extend, but that do not transform, the nature of scholarly publishing. Digital humanities projects, on the other hand, are designed to be iterative in nature, with the potential for revision and expansion as knowledge of a subject evolves. Integrating university press publication with emerging practices of digital humanities scholarship, Manifold Scholarship breaks from the prevalent format-based terms \u201cprint,\u201d \u201cebook,\u201d and \u201cenhanced ebook,\u201d defining scholarly work instead as either \u201citerative\u201d or \u201cstatic,\u201d with the latter term encompassing both print editions and their replicated, fixed ebook editions. In doing so, publishing conceptions and practices are productively reoriented toward a hybrid-publishing model of Open Access iterative books while simultaneously producing traditional, static formats, meeting the needs of many markets and distribution channels.\\n\\n## Rethinking Authorship, Procedures, and Workflow\\nWeb-based iterative publishing requires a new understanding of what constitutes an author\u2019s manuscript, and new editorial procedures to standardize and streamline author and editor workflow in a way that makes it manageable and sustainable for the scholarly community. In past editorial models, scholars created a manuscript for print, and sometimes created an accompanying project website for ancillary materials. We are asking authors to consider, from the very beginning of the research process, developing and sharing their project iteratively. Research materials, filmed images, field notes, ethnographic materials, sketches, maps, audio recordings, interviews, and other forms of research that are used to write the monograph will have a place on Manifold so that scholars can share their work as it is being researched and written. One of the greatest strengths of the university press is creating efficient and replicable publishing procedures; as a part of Manifold Scholarship, we will work collaboratively with authors on pilot projects, establishing a set of procedures and best practices for preparing the materials for web-based publication, while refining the production workflow needed to publish Manifold projects while simultaneously producing static formats.\\n\\n## The Next Steps\\n\\nWe are excited about Manifold Scholarship and about sharing our progress and our thinking as the project develops. We\u2019re building Manifold on Rails 5, with Node and React; come back next week for a post by Cast Iron Coding partner Zach Davis, as he discusses our technology stack choices. In early November, Minnesota Editorial Director Jason Weidemann will discuss what makes a scholarly project suitable for publication on Manifold, and then CUNY Graduate Fellow Jeff Binder will discuss annotation.\\n\\nWe hope you\'ll join us, and we look forward to your feedback.\\n\\n\u2014 Doug Armato and Matthew K.
