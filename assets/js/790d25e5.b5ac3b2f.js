For other presses, third-party service providers, or packagers, handle the creation of electronic editions in parallel with print or as an afterthought to it. That is to say, even when print isn\u2019t to be the only medium of publication, it still receives primacy over all other editions.

And it\u2019s time to grapple with the fact that scholarly publishing involves more than books, more than journals, more than print. It\u2019s not tied to paper; it\u2019s not a function of the software it passes through. Instead, it\u2019s the expression of content in the most meaningful and impactful ways possible.
