Consider our examples here. We have a standard body paragraph coded with just ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"<p>")," tags, and we have a paragraph that has a class of ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"bio"),". Both are paragraphs, but one is a specific kind of paragraph. If on our stylesheet we decided that all paragraphs should have a first line-indent, so we can easily track new paragraphs as we read, then that indent would apply to both of our sample paragraphs equally. But maybe we don\u2019t need for the bio paragraph to have a first line indent. Because it has it\u2019s own class, we can add another instruction to our stylesheet that says elements with a class of ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"bio")," ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,i.kt)("em",{parentName:"strong"},"don\u2019t"))," have a first-line indent."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Taking a half-step back, that ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"bio")," class attribute in our second example is possible because Manifold can map Word styles to existing HTML elements.

That\u2019s what\u2019s really nifty: users with Admin roles can define the specifics of how Word styles are mapped to HTML in Manifold to really get the results they want.
