The fixed form of the book, for example, doesn\u2019t reflect the long duration of research, the months of ethnography, the full compliment of data collection and archival deep-dives. The monograph doesn\u2019t record the full chorus of voices that help shape a project, such as the feedback of colleagues and peers. Research is already iterative, benefitting from community dialogue and from interfacing with an array of media.

There\u2019s often little travel between the website and the physical book, and these websites quickly fade away, disconnected by link rot or taken down from university servers when a scholar switches institutions. But these objects are never ancillary\u2014they are part and parcel of the work itself. One potential Manifold author remarked to me that the traditional book doesn\u2019t offer readers the chance to review the primary materials and say, \u201cI disagree.\u201d Manifold will allow authors to embed these objects within or alongside the text so that readers can chart their own course through all the elements that make up a scholarly book and research project."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This feature is especially important to Manifold author Mara Mills, assistant professor of media, culture and communication at New York University.
