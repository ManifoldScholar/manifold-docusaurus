Manifold is intentionally designed to enable scholars and publishers the means to both embrace and comfortably extend beyond traditional modes while still remaining familiar, intuitive, and scalable. Manifold is more than just a pretty platform\u2014it\u2019s a means to add value to scholarly publications of all kinds.Our conversations at Temple, as they did at Indiana and Athabasca prior, quickly moved from the process and mechanics of how to do things in Manifold to how Manifold can be used to do so much more than we\u2019re used to. It was a thrill to have Mary Rose creating new projects on their instance and talking strategy with Annie on one half of the table, while I was fielding questions from other team members about editorial and marketing process and expectations.
