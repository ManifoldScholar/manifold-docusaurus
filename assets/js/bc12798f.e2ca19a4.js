In browse mode, the screen reader extracts page content from the DOM into an invisible text layer known as the \u201cvirtual buffer.\u201d In this mode, all keystrokes are intercepted by the screen reader. The browser, and Manifold, know nothing about them. Manifold community members have reported that while in browse mode, both NVDA and JAWS read out the user\u2019s keyboard text selection, but that the text itself is not visibly selected and Manifold\u2019s annotation menu doesn\u2019t open as it does when selected by a mouse. We\u2019ve tested this in NVDA and can confirm this behavior\u2014even after our most recent work, forthcoming version 8.0, that persists a user\u2019s place in a text after using the keyboard to access the annotation pop-up or drawer.

Keystrokes in this mode are sent directly to the application controlled by the screen reader, which in this case is the browser and Manifold. In focus mode, with caret browsing enabled in the browser, users can annotate with their keyboard, but the screen reader does not announce what text a user has actually selected for annotation. This, again, is to be expected. These screen readers only announce selection in the virtual buffer. So while it is technically possible to annotate in focus mode, functionally speaking, screen-reader users who have low or no vision will not be able to easily annotate a text, since they won\u2019t know what text they have selected without first having to change between focus and browse modes."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Our friends at Hypothes.is have a really helpful issue in their ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://github.com/hypothesis/product-backlog/issues/1148"},"GitHub repository")," that provides further background on this challenge and demonstrates how it is not something that can be solved by Manifold or any other tool for annotating on the web."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"On the bright side, the issue in the Hypothes.is repository links to recent work in Microsoft\u2019s accessibility API and in NVDA to couple text selection between the DOM and virtual buffer.
