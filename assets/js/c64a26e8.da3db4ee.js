A label indicates a field\u2019s purpose, as placeholder text is not always read by screen readers and input types can be too general to be considered adequately informative.

In general form errors on Manifold always appear next to the field with the error. For AT this is not ideal (it\u2019s much more convenient to have all of the errors routed to a single element\u2014like a flash message\u2014all the time), but we can well accommodate this placement by using the role attribute in conjunction with a handful of other ARIA attributes.

However, used judiciously, ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://medium.com/@matuzo/writing-javascript-with-accessibility-in-mind-a1f6a5f467b9"},"redirecting focus")," can make it easier for a user, especially an AT user, to understand where they are on the page and what interaction is expected of them. In some cases this is as simple as focusing on a the first form field when a form is rendered on the page: this immediately presents the most important interaction to the user (filling out the form) and keeps the user from having to navigate page content that otherwise may not have changed. Sometimes it means controlling the focus using JavaScript in order to maintain a complicated DOM flow. However, sometimes redirecting focus isn\u2019t enough of a provocation. In the case of interactions that present the user with a disparate element like a drawer, overlay, dialog box, dropdown menu, etc., we not only want to the redirect focus to an element inside the drawer, we also want to ensure that the user interacts with the contents of that element before it is hidden. To accomplish this we\u2019ll use a strategy called a ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap-react"},"focus trap")," to restrict the user to the active element. Let\u2019s use the example of a dialog box containing a prompt asking you to \u201cConfirm the deletion of Text X\u201d, with \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cCancel\u201d buttons. For the sighted user this confirmation dialog takes over the whole screen. Using a mouse to navigate the page, the user must click \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cCancel\u201d to continue. And this makes sense. We want the user to have to make a decision. If this confirmation dialog wasn\u2019t a takeover, the user might click \u201cDelete\u201d and move on, not noticing or realizing they needed to confirm their choice. So, to emulate this behavior on AT, we use a focus trap to restrict focus to only elements inside the confirmation dialog. If the user is tabbing through content, AT will read the prompt and the buttons text over and over until they interact with one or the other button. If we don\u2019t enact a focus trap, AT would allow the user to tab through and then out of the dialog, continuing to traverse the page as normal and, depending on the contents of that dialog, this could have unwanted consequences. So, to reiterate, in this simple example, we will use a focus trap to ensure that when a user activates the confirmation dialog they won\u2019t miss the messaging, and they will be required to interact with it before moving on, just as a non-AT user would do. Not all uses of the focus trap are so simple, but the ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap-react"},"react-focus-trap component")," we use offers enough options and flexibility to implement it effectively without too many concessions. One important consideration when using a focus trap: if we\u2019ve trapped focus inside a dialog, drawer, etc., we must provide them with an interaction to escape the trap. In most cases we can provide a default \u201cpress esc key to close,\u201d but this should be used in addition to an \u201con screen\u201d interaction. Usually we provide a close button inside the focus trap to allow the user to escape the trap without having affected any other change. In some cases we only need to make this close button available to AT as some other click-based interaction is otherwise available."),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"nav-skip"},"Nav Skip"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"In the most basic sense, AT reads the page from top to bottom every time the page loads. This can hamper UX on a screen reader as it might force a user to traverse the same content over and over as they navigate between pages. In addition to simply tabbing through content, most AT will sort page content in enough different ways to allow the user to access whatever part of the page is most relevant to them.
