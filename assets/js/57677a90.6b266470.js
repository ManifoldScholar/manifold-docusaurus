Teachers can create educational materials that can be shared only with students in a particular class. Works in progress can be shared with a select group of peer reviewers. Creators of collaborative projects can share drafts with a team for feedback.

In the months to come, we plan to add a suite of complementary features to this architecture, including the ability to add large numbers of users simultaneously through ingestion of CSV files.
