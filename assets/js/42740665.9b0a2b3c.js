The original DDH site, launched in 2013, was the early prototype for Manifold, so it was great to move the whole series onto the fully featured platform, and it was all the more impactful because the series has grown so much, allowing us -- through the goodwill of our fantastic publisher, the University of Minnesota Press -- to release all volumes in the series on an open-access basis.

I\u2019m a big fan of Sloan\u2019s newsletter and I love the way it bounces between internet curiosities, digital media, economics, cultural trends, and thoughts about what the future holds for the business of writing and publishing. Describing the Gernsback book, Sloan wrote \u201cWhen it comes to these academic web publishing platforms, I am always a great fan of the vision but often a reluctant reader of the text; the platforms tend towards heaviness and clunkiness. Manifold is neither, and maybe more importantly, it\u2019s a great match for this book, which is naturally random-access.\u201d That bit of feedback has stuck with me because it hit on so many of the things that are challenging and engaging about this project. With Manifold, we\u2019ve tried to build a platform that fundamentally gets out of the way of the reading experience while also bringing a little bit of design, a little personality to the encounter between the reader and the text. I love the feeling of holding a fine book in my hands. Can we get to something ",(0,o.jsx)(t.em,{children:"like"})," that feeling on a screen? What would that look like, if we could?I really value the act of reading, which I often think of as a kind of discourse or friendship in which my mind gets tangled up in a sometimes ethical, sometimes rhetorical engagement with other minds. What can a reading and publishing platform add to that engagement? Reading\u2019s pretty great and, after all, the physical book is about as perfect an object as humanity has come up with. The act of reading on a computer starts out from such a degraded place that it\u2019s no small task figuring out how to add something to that experience.So, It\u2019s a great feeling, hearing from a reader, especially one whom I admire, that the platform helped him engage the material in a way that felt exploratory and freeing rather than limiting, that it got out of his way and maybe brought a little joy into the act of engaging another mind. I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled to be part of a project that gives me a chance to be involved in ongoing conversations about how knowledge is produced, how it\u2019s disseminated, and how it\u2019s consumed.
