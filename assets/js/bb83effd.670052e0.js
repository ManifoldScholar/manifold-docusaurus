The monograph doesn\u2019t record the full chorus of voices that help shape a project, such as the feedback of colleagues and peers.

But these objects are never ancillary\u2014they are part and parcel of the work itself.

Taking advantage of these tools, an author will also become a curator, shaping archives, providing context for readers, and illustrating the varied parts that make up her book and larger research project.
