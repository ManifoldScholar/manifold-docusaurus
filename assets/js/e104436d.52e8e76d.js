As we move toward a stable 1.0.0 release, our focus has been on improving Manifold's performance and stability, and to that end we've managed to pack 85 documented bug fixes into this version. Our work on this release was heavily influenced by the university presses and academic centers who have expressed interest in Manifold, and for whom we've set up instances of Manifold on Google's cloud infrastructure. The feedback we've received from these groups around what they're looking for in a platform like Manifold has been invaluable, and has guided many of our development choices. Many of the new features\u2014making project pages more customizable, providing content management functionality, improvements to our EPUB ingestion process, draft projects, and improved open graph tagging\u2014are intended to speak to other presses' need to customize Manifold and make it their own."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"In addition to the ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0"},"230 commits"),"we've made since ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/tree/v0.2.0"},"v0.2.0"),", we've also been working behind the scenes on making it easier for interested groups to try out Manifold. We're close to completion on a MacOS package installer (.pkg) for Manifold that will allow developers, scholars, and presses to run a Manifold instance locally on their Mac desktop or laptop (primarily for evaluation purposes). Soon thereafter, we'll be releasing Ubuntu packages (.deb), which will make installing Manifold as simple as setting up a VM (on Google Cloud, Digital Ocean, etc) and running a few apt-get commands. We expect to release these installers by the end of October. Before the end of 2017, we plan on providing docker images for those of you who prefer containers.
