To engage with the question of preservation earnestly, we first need to better understand the ecosystem, expectations, and available options. A good part of the work we are presently undertaking is in educating ourselves, through independent research and in talking with librarians and other experts to help us craft a course that meets the needs of our users today and the needs of users years hence. Those needs inform two very simple questions that are foundational to our endeavor: What are we preserving and how are we preserving it?"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"For multimodal projects, the question of ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"what")," may be simple, but it's certainly not easy, and the implications of exploring it are, well, manifold. For instance, do we want to be opinionated about preserving works in progress versus a peer-reviewed version of record? What constitutes the version of record when there isn't a corresponding print edition? Does that answer affect the mechanisms of preservation we're enabling, or is that a question best reserved for individual publishers? What about comments authors and readers have made on the system? Should we aim to make it possible to preserve all of them? Just a subset? The public ones, or perhaps a select, curated collection? What about those comments that are part of classroom work? How do we signal such intent to those making the comments, and does that alter their possible engagement? What about interactions brought in through social media? And then there are ancillary resources. Do we simply preserve the source files and their metadata, or do we work to make them relational to their placement/function in and around the text they are supporting? What about resources that the platform isn't hosting\u2014do we want to only preserve their metadata or can/should we go further?

This is a targeted strategy that looks at the content itself independent of any software required to run it. It also necessitates intermittent review for possible further transformations.
