At the time, Krysia was on the development team for Manifold at the Grad Center working as an open educational technologist. We both knew a mutual colleague of ours, Matt Gold, who was directing the Digital Humanities initiatives at the Grad Center. Through Krysia and fellow technologist Jojo Karlin, I discovered how to adapt Manifold into my upcoming class for the MALS program, \u201cAmerican Culture and Values.\u201d Through their generous time and instruction, I learned more about the platform and its capacities, and was able to design an interactive assignment around the recovery of Hubert Harrison\u2019s out of print book from 1917, The Negro and the Nation.

The project, punningly entitled \u201cThe Manifold Harrison,\u201d became a center of gravity for classroom discussion throughout the semester. Since one of the key aspects of our assignment was annotating the text, many of our discussions focused on how to connect passages from the text to other works of American Studies we were reading. As students read each other\u2019s annotations, their comments and feedback led to recurring conversations between them. Many took place before and after class.

To address the former, I made clear that their reactions, connections, and comments upon The Negro and the Nation were necessary elements of \u2018recovering\u2019 Harrison and his work. They were not only \u2018recent voices\u2019 on the text, but some of the only ones, sadly, that were identifying passages of interest to American Studies and to a wider public. In short, their efforts were important, but also, inevitably, novel.

Manifold is a powerful platform within the ecosystem of open access texts for both undergraduate and graduate students, in part because it models a kind of dynamic, media-rich, and mobile-friendly reading experience that students so often associate with for-profit apps and sites. For me, part of Manifold\u2019s value comes from its ability to socialize the reading process, and to provide tools for collaboration around \u2018academic\u2019 reading practices that are competitive with, and more than equal to, the online experiences students naturally couple with platform capitalism.
