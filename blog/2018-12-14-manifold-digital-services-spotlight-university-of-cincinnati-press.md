This is part 5 of the Travels with Terence series, following our digital projects editor on his pilot press in-person training program.[![](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/12/bearcatgopher.jpg)](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/12/bearcatgopher.jpg) Jojo illustrates the Cincy Bearcat and UMinn gopher. At the [University of Cincinnati Press](https://ucincinnatipress.uc.edu/), Manifold is in the capable hands of Elizabeth Scarpelli, Press Director. Terence headed to Cincinnati almost immediately on the heels of the team’s Portland face-to-face (recap blog post to follow), so he was well primed to address their hopes and challenges.[![University of Cincinnati sign on a bench in front of a building and trees](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/12/uc.jpg)](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/12/uc.jpg) Following their last training session, Terence and Sean made a final coffee run, which took them past the entrance to the university. When selected for the Manifold Digital Services Pilot, Liz said:

> Manifold will help us further our mission to publish new modes of scholarship and enhanced publications by providing a professional, agile, and dynamic presentation site for our authors and readers. We anticipate using Manifold for many of our publications from traditional monographs to digitally innovative projects designed to expand the dialogue between scholars and community based experts and practitioners. We see Manifold as a key tool in our discoverability strategy at the University of Cincinnati Press and Cincinnati Library Publishing Services (CLIPS). The mission based approach and affordability and technical support available through the pilot make Manifold an easy choice in partners for us.

Renick’s 1977 sculpture to commemorate the US Bicentennial, _Triceracopter: The Hope for the Obsolescence of War_, is housed in the library just steps from where the press offices will soon be relocated. Following Terence’s two and a half days with the University of Cincinnati Press, the team seemed excited to have closed out the year looking forward to the work ahead. With thanks to Sean Crowe, University of Cincinnati Press’s library developer and press digital architect, Terence met with press staff, librarians, publicity staff, and senior administrators. As a new press, founded in 2017, Cincinnati is looking to leverage its size, versatility, and integration within the library to innovate across disciplines in service to its mission to the global community as well as to the faculty and the community on campus. Manifold’s commitment to openness also aligns with the university’s mission. Manifold’s emphasis on reader experience, iterative possibilities for authors, and connective annotation tools support the press’s aim to bring authors and readers closer through dialog.[![The Genius of Water is an iconic fountain situated in downtown Cincinnati.

Unfortunately it was too cold to have the water running, but it wasn’t too cold for ice cream following a brief tour and viewing of the area. Upon his return, Terence remarked:

> This was such an exciting trip. You can feel how everyone on the team is eager to have the opportunity to innovate with Manifold. In addition to having openly accessible titles on their instance, Cincinnati is going to cultivate and promote iterative projects that really push the system to its limits and take advantage of all the capabilities we’ve worked to provide. I’m so thrilled to have the opportunity to work with them and to help them achieve their vision.
