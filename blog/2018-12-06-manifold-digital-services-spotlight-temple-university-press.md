This is part 4 of the Travels with Terence series, following our digital projects editor on his pilot press in-person training program.[![Illustration of an owl wearing a Temple University logo and a gopher with a UMinn Press tote as papers around them transform into Manifold logos](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/12/TempleOwlGopher.jpg)](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/12/TempleOwlGopher.jpg) &nbsp; This week brought Terence to [Temple University Press](http://tupress.temple.edu/) in Philadelphia! Given his American Ninja Warrior tendencies, he’d planned to run the “Rocky stairs” at the art museum, but after a recent injury, he opted to spend that time resting and recuperating over a lovely Indian dinner.The Manifold pilot at Temple is being spearheaded by [Mary Rose Muccie](https://twitter.com/MRMuccie), Director, Temple University Press and Scholarly Communications Officer, Temple University Libraries, and [Annie Johnson](https://twitter.com/anniekjohn), Library Publishing and Scholarly Communications Specialist, Temple University Libraries. Terence had the chance to meet with both and remarked:

> As I was preparing for the trip last week, going over some of our earlier exchanges, I was caught by something that Mary Rose wrote: ‘We can learn a lot from readers, and Manifold will give us a window into how they react to, interact with, and use our content, something we can't get with a traditional print or electronic book.’ I think that really speaks to the power of the platform. Manifold is intentionally designed to enable scholars and publishers the means to both embrace and comfortably extend beyond traditional modes while still remaining familiar, intuitive, and scalable. Manifold is more than just a pretty platform—it’s a means to add value to scholarly publications of all kinds.Our conversations at Temple, as they did at Indiana and Athabasca prior, quickly moved from the process and mechanics of how to do things in Manifold to how Manifold can be used to do so much more than we’re used to. It was a thrill to have Mary Rose creating new projects on their instance and talking strategy with Annie on one half of the table, while I was fielding questions from other team members about editorial and marketing process and expectations. It’s a kick to be able to really talk shop in a collaborative and explorative way.[![View of modern library with trees and construction barriers in foreground](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/12/temple-library.jpg)](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/12/temple-library.jpg) The new library at Temple, now under construction and scheduled to open next summer, will also house the press, which presently resides off campus.

Exploring new possibilities is exhilarating and thirsty work. Temple University Press has a reputation as a social justice press because of its long history of—and continued commitment to—publishing in labor studies, ethnic studies, gender and sexuality studies, and urban studies.
