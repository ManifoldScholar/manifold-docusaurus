Dear Manifold community!

We are always working to make it easier to use Manifold at all levels. To this end, we teamed up with the [DigitalOcean community](https://www.digitalocean.com/) to make the process of installing Manifold on your own even easier.

Check out our new post, "[How To Install and Set Up Manifold Scholar](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-set-up-manifold-scholar)," on their website! Follow the streamlined tutorial to get Manifold up and running on your own Digital Ocean Droplet.

As ever, we invite your questions, your stories, your involvement. Follow along on [Github](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/projects/7) for more details and to request features. Feel free to reach out on the community [Slack channel](https://manifold-slackin.herokuapp.com/) or tweet us at [@manifoldscholar.](https://twitter.com/ManifoldScholar)
