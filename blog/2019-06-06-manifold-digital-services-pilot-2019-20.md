MINNEAPOLIS, MN (June 6, 2019)—The Manifold team is pleased to announce the selection of the following ten organizations to participate in the second year of the Manifold Digital Services pilot program:

- [Affordable Learning Georgia](https://www.affordablelearninggeorgia.org/)
- [Arte Público Press](https://artepublicopress.com/recovery-project/)
- [Daughters of the African Atlantic](https://www.africanatlanticdaughters.com/)
- [Fembot Collective](https://fembot.adanewmedia.org)
- [Gallaudet University Press](http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/)
- [George Washington University Publishing Master of Professional Studies Program](http://cps.gwu.edu/publishing)
- [Intermezzo](http://intermezzo.enculturation.net/)
- [Lapham’s Quarterly](http://www.laphamsquarterly.org)
- [MESH, Michigan State University](http://www.meshresearch.net/)
- [University of Georgia Press](https://ugapress.org)

These programs were chosen from a pool of highly competitive and diverse applicants, and will each receive their own installations of the platform and in-person training to assist them in using Manifold to further their missions of scholarly research, publishing, and pedagogy. Like the [first-year pilot participants](http://blog.manifoldapp.org/2018/08/30/ten-publishers-to-begin-using-manifold/), these groups represent university presses, libraries, periodical and journal publishers, digital humanities centers, professional associations, academic units, and collectives of scholars from around the globe.

Doug Armato, director of the University of Minnesota Press, says, “We are excited to work with these organizations in the year ahead. Since we began developing Manifold in 2015 we have seen a tremendous amount of publishing activity taking place within university departments and centers among groups of scholars. Listening to these groups, along with university presses and library publishers, is essential as we push Manifold’s development to meet these diverse and broader publishing needs.”

The Manifold platform now supports a wide variety of publications beyond longform scholarship, including interactive projects, textbooks, pamphlets, journals, open educational resources, and projects made up entirely of audio/visual elements. During the course of the pilot, the Manifold team will continue to develop features that extend its functionality for publishers, teachers, and students—including support for private annotation groups and access controls for classroom use.

Matthew K. Gold, associate professor of English and digital humanities at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York, says, “We’ve seen the formation of a vibrant community of users who are integrating Manifold into various classroom settings as they engage students in the work of annotating OER editions of course texts, build out critical editions with ancillary materials, and create assignments that use Manifold as a publication space for collaborative student work.”

Manifold is an open-source, web-based publishing platform that enables publication of networked and enhanced digital projects that fit into existing publication workflows. It is free to install for those groups seeking a do-it-yourself publishing platform, and the [Manifold team offers services that support publishing activities](https://manifoldapp.org/services).

Manifold is a collaborative project created by the[University of Minnesota Press](https://www.upress.umn.edu/),[the GC Digital Scholarship Lab at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York](https://gcdsl.commons.gc.cuny.edu/home2/), and the digital development agency[Cast Iron Coding](http://castironcoding.com/). The installation and training for these ten publishers is supported by a grant from[The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/).
