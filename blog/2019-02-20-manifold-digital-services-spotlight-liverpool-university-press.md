This is part 8 of the Travels with Terence series, following our digital projects editor on his pilot press in-person training program. In one of his first dispatches from Liverpool, Terence noted to the team back home:

<!--truncate-->



> the energy at the press is incredible and catching. All the more because so many of the staff have traveled from afar—Oxford, Dublin, and even as far away as Poland!—to be a part of the sessions. The more we delve into what Manifold can do the more everyone is looking to push what we've built in ways we haven't yet considered.

[![red door in brick building](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/02/lup.jpg)](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/02/lup.jpg) The press offices are situated in cozy brick building on campus. They even have a fireplace in their kitchen! Given the diversity of the sample materials Allison Welsby, the press’s editorial director, provided, Cast Iron Coding outfitted Liverpool's instance with an early release of Manifold version 3.0. With 3.0 we’re introducing support for a [variety of new kinds of projects](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/1209). Liverpool was a prime candidate. When they were selected for the Manifold Digital Services pilot, the Liverpool team commented:

> All university presses should strive to meet the needs of authors, whether through traditional formats and workflows or through innovation and additional functionality. Manifold gives us the opportunity to offer something different.

The difference offered will hopefully expand and augment the great work the press has been producing since 1899. The third oldest university press in the UK, Liverpool University Press has kept young with new initiatives and offerings. One of the thirteen presses who participated in the [Knowledge Unlatched](http://knowledgeunlatched.org/) pilot, a global library consortium approach to funding [open access books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_book), Liverpool is at the forefront of presses seeking means to increase access to titles and broaden the reach and scope of their publications.[![door to the red brick Maternity where John Lennon was born](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/02/lennon.jpg)](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/02/lennon.jpg) Just down the street from the press is the old maternity ward where John Lennon was born. Beyond his meetings at the press, Terence also had the opportunity to be part of the Love Open Love Research Love Data week, a joint collaboration between the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) and the [Liverpool John Moores University Libraries](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/microsites/library). When he returned, Terence reflected:

> I can’t thank Alison enough for setting up the session. We don’t always get the chance to engage with the scholarly community in the UK directly, and this proved to be a wonderful opportunity to make new in-person connections and learn more about the work going on in those spaces. I’m looking forward to continuing the conversations we began in the weeks and months ahead.

 &nbsp; [![view across water to large, low brick building](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/02/tate.jpg)](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2019/02/tate.jpg) The Tate gallery in the Albert Dock went unvisited by Terence. The lure of fish ’n chips was apparently too great a lure.

**Miles traveled:** 9,004

**Near Misses:** Had he been fifteen minutes earlier, Terence would have been able to have seen Prince Charles, who was conducting an event just a little ways from his hotel.
