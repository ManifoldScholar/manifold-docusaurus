On Tuesday, November 10, I was very happy to participate in an online conversation&nbsp;convened by the&nbsp;Association of American University Presses (AAUP) on the topic of "Opening Access: The Reinvention of the Academic Book." During the session, which was moderated by Jennifer Howard of the&nbsp;_Chronicle of Higher Education_, I discussed the Manifold Scholarship project and issues related to digital monographs with my fellow panelists&nbsp;Frances Pinter (Manchester University Press/Knowledge Unlatched), Peter Suber (Harvard University Berkman Center for Internet & Society), and Augusta Rohrbach (author of _Thinking Outside the Book_). An archived video of the session is below, along with descriptive information about the event. I'm grateful to the AAUP for this opportunity to discuss the project! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMXc-xwbRy0 From AAUP: **Streamed live on Nov 10, 2015** How to publish the best possible scholarship in the best possible way is at the heart of AAUP members' consideration of the value of university presses and the future of the academic book. There are two parallel streams of technological and cultural change that drive these debates: the model for access to scholarship (we might think of this as "who pays?") and the format or process for "publishing" scholarship (particularly in the long-form focused fields of the humanities and social sciences.) As University Press Week is celebrated, and as part of the Academic Book Week Great Debate series, AAUP is sponsoring an online discussion between thinkers and practitioners swimming in both streams. Moderated by Jennifer Howard (_Chronicle of Higher Education_), the conversation will include Frances Pinter (Manchester University Press/Knowledge Unlatched), a publisher of both traditional print and innovative Open Access monographs; Peter Suber (Harvard University Berkman Center for Internet & Society), one of the foremost theorists of Open Access; Augusta Rohrbach (author of _Thinking Outside the Book_), a scholar of book culture embedded in a world of digital communications; and Matthew K. Gold (CUNY Graduate Center), who, with the team on the Manifold project, is transforming scholarly publications into living digital works. -- Matthew K. Gold
