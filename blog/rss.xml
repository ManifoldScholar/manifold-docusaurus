            <description><![CDATA[One of the highlights of 2021 was that we held our first quarterly Manifold Community Meetup. Something we love about building Manifold is seeing all of the amazing projects and initiatives that Manifold makes possible across the different groups and institutions who use it. At the same time, we found that publishers using Manifold often asked us for a means through which to discover what other Manifold instances are up to and how they have solved common challenges and obstacles. And so we inaugurated Manifold Community Meetups: a quarterly virtual meetup for Manifold community members to share practices, discuss strategies, ask questions, troubleshoot difficulties, and learn from each other.]]></description>

The Washington team has performed an ongoing audit of Manifold over that time, and our two groups meet regularly to discuss new ideas and strategies for making the application even more performant for readers and content creators using assistive technologies.]]></description>

Last week Terence set off on his first trip of 2019, journeying to Atlanta to meet with faculty and staff across Emory University. Unlike other pilot programs, Manifold at Emory isn’t centered around a university press or library. Instead the initiative is being spearheaded by Sarah McKee of the Bill and Carol Fox Center for Humanistic Inquiry and Wayne Morse, Allen Tullos, and Yang Li of the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship, for use by students and faculty with local projects and programming and as a means to introduce the community at large to new modes of publication that publishers with whom local scholars may already be working can take advantage.]]></description>

In creating a platform for publishers to collect and disseminate singular works that contribute to the scholarly record, it is imperative that we provide a means to preserve those works against the rigors of time and technological obsolescence. Publishers, authors, and the communities they serve need to be confident the materials they are publishing on Manifold will not only be discoverable, but also reliably accessible and useable for future engagement.]]></description>

I have been lucky to work with Matt for a couple of years now, through seminars on digital humanities praxis and textual studies, on DH tool-building projects like DH Box, on the editorial collective of the Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy, and with the digital fellows of the GC Digital Initiatives. His widespread commitment to textual scholarship and digital innovation, his seemingly tireless support of his students and digital experimentation, and his humility (which he may not even let me mention) never cease to amaze me. I have spent a lot of time discussing Manifold with Matt, but I was glad to get the chance to ask him more specifically about his personal motivations for developing a hybrid publishing platform.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[While the seismic ruptures of the election have unsettled the ground beneath us, it feels necessary to continue working on projects that look beyond the next four years, that address the possibility of connecting people through ideas and through constructive debate. Last week, in the midst of national turmoil, I had the pleasure of interviewing Susan Doerr, University of Minnesota Press Assistant Director, Digital Publishing and Operations. During our phone call, I asked Susan a number of questions about her thoughts on reading and the Manifold platform.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Welcome to a new regular feature on the Building Manifold blog: "This Week in Manifold." As we move toward a beta version of Manifold (scheduled for March, 2017), I'll be releasing a Manifold build to our staging server every Friday afternoon. Each release will be accompanied by a blog post explaining what the development team accomplished in the sprint leading up to the release. This post comes a few days late. When the Internet broke last week, our ability to release builds from Github was impacted, which delayed things a bit. I expect we'll be back on schedule this week, with our next build going out on Friday, October 28.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[As Jason indicated in this space earlier, Manifold is not simply an endeavor to create a better publishing platform; it is an answer to the challenge of rethinking and reframing the concept of scholarly publishing. In broad strokes, scholarly publishing is very much still a print-centric enterprise. Despite the vast libraries of electronic publications available, the systems, mindsets, and expectations of the greater university press culture—including those of authors and the academy—are engineered specifically for print.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[As Manifold Scholarship progresses through its first rounds of wireframes, editors at the University of Minnesota Press are already discussing the platform with authors and considering book projects. Manifold will have an impact on the full span of a project, from the early stages of researching and collecting data for a book, to the drafting of a proposal, to peer review and press evaluation, and across the iterative stages of a manuscript’s organic development leading to the peer reviewed, published edition. Just as Manifold is designed to transform the nature of scholarly publishing, we are also asking scholars, from their earliest articulations, to think elastically about the ways in which Manifold can expand their project beyond the static, physical book.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[On Tuesday, November 10, I was very happy to participate in an online conversation convened by the Association of American University Presses (AAUP) on the topic of "Opening Access: The Reinvention of the Academic Book." During the session, which was moderated by Jennifer Howard of the Chronicle of Higher Education, I discussed the Manifold Scholarship project and issues related to digital monographs with my fellow panelists Frances Pinter (Manchester University Press/Knowledge Unlatched), Peter Suber (Harvard University Berkman Center for Internet & Society), and Augusta Rohrbach (author of Thinking Outside the Book). An archived video of the session is below, along with descriptive information about the event. I'm grateful to the AAUP for this opportunity to discuss the project!]]></description>
