MINNEAPOLIS, MN (August 30, 2018)—The Manifold team has selected the following ten groups to receive free installation and training on the Manifold platform to help them meet their digital publishing goals:

- Athabasca University Press,
- the University of Cincinnati Press and Library Publishing Services,
- Concordia University Press,
- Emory Center for Digital Scholarship,
- Indiana University Press,
- Liverpool University Press,
- Reanimate publishing collective,
- Temple University Press,
- the University of Washington Press and Libraries, and
- the University of the West Indies Press.
 These groups represent university presses, university library publishing groups, humanities centers, and a collective of scholars from across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the West Indies, each seeking an alternative editorial path for digital scholarly publishing. Doug Armato, University of Minnesota Press Director, says, “We are excited to have this opportunity to help other university presses, library publishing groups, and university centers install and get started in using the Manifold platform as part of their work to publish scholarship on the web. Working with these groups will allow the Manifold team to better understand the goals and needs of publishers who install the platform, and incorporate that feedback into our planning for Manifold’s future development.” Other development priorities during the next two years include enriching the reading experience for users of assistive technology; expanding interoperability with other platforms, including support for access restriction; creating preservation strategies for scholarship published on the platform; adding new templates for projects; and a CUNY-led research project focused on open education resources (OER) uses of the platform. Manifold is an open-source, web-based publishing platform that easily integrates the publication of networked and enhanced ebooks with existing publication workflows. It is free to install for those groups seeking a do-it-yourself publishing platform, or the Manifold team offers services to support publishers. The Manifold team is made up of a partnership between the [University of Minnesota Press](https://www.upress.umn.edu/), [the GC Digital Scholarship Lab at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York](https://gcdsl.commons.gc.cuny.edu/home2/), and digital development agency [Cast Iron Coding](http://castironcoding.com/). The installation and training for these ten publishers is supported by a grant from [The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/).
