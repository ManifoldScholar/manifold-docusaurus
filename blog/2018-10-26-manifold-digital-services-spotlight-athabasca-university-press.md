## Travels with Terence, Part 2

In honor of OA Week, we‚Äôre taking the chance to do a spotlight on our first Manifold Digital Services Pilot press‚Äî[Athabasca University Press](http://aupress.ca/), Canada‚Äôs first open access scholarly press!

Terence traveled to Edmonton, Alberta, this week to work with AU Press, and, it would seem, to eat his fair share of Tim Horton‚Äôs.

AU Press publishes journals and monographs and makes its scholarship freely available to encourage broad readership. Megan Hall, acting director, is leading the Manifold integration. She remarks, ‚ÄúOver the last few years, we have heard from scholars interested in producing books enhanced with audio and video, primary research and archival documents, and social reading features. Manifold will allow us to experiment with all of these possibilities in addition to enabling us, as an open access press, to offer free books that are mobile-friendly and value-added.‚Äù

Over the course of two days of training, Terence and the Athabasca team were able to work through the major features of the platform and explore how Manifold can be leveraged not only from a production standpoint, but also from editorial and marketing perspectives. Terence said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about face-to-face meetings that can‚Äôt be replicated on a web call. Being in the same room allows you to engage in a much more organic way, and because of that we were able to really tease out some new ideas that will only help make Manifold better. Traveling to Edmonton in person made all the difference.‚Äù
