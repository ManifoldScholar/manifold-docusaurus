On behalf of the entire Manifold team, I'm super excited to announce the release of Manifold v0.2.0! The release is up on [Github](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/tree/v0.2.0) now, and we'll be rolling it out to our [staging site](http://staging.manifoldapp.org) later today. This release contains a number of new features and bugfixes, listed below. For the full list of revisions and pull requests, please consult the [changelog](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/blob/v0.2.0/CHANGELOG.md).

Remember, Manifold is open source and freely available to all who are interested. While we have plans to build docker containers and OS packages, we've also written up [installation instructions](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold-docs/blob/master/developers/installation/development.md) for all you early adopters out there. Take it for a spin and let us know how it goes. As always, we appreciate any feedback. To support our effort and motivate our development team, please take a moment to watch or star our repository on Github!
