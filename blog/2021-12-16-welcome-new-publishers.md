---

The Manifold Team is delighted to announce the six publishers who will be joining the Manifold community in 2022 with grant-funded support packages, thanks to generous funding from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

This international group takes Manifold in bold new directions, and includes two renowned art museums; an association for cultural studies and digital collection research; a digital magazine that unites the best of the university with the openness of the internet; a scholarly journal of film, media and digital culture; and a network of open education advocates.

Please join us in welcoming them to the Manifold community:

- [Apparatus Journal](https://www.apparatusjournal.net/index.php/apparatus)
- [Malaysian Institute of Art](https://mia.edu.my/)
- [Marbach Weimar Wolfenbüttel Research Association](https://www.mww-forschung.de/en/home)
- [Open Education Network](https://open.umn.edu/otn/)
- [Public Books](https://www.publicbooks.org/)
- [Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art](https://asia.si.edu/)

We hope to introduce some of these new publishers at the next Manifold Community Meetup, which will be held virtually on **Tuesday, February 15, 2022 at 11:00 am EST**. These quarterly meetups are a chance for Manifold users to make connections and solve common problems, to showcase how they're using Manifold's features, and hear about cutting-edge developments to the platform. Save the date! We will be sending out a formal invitation early in the new year.

In welcoming these new publishers to our platform, we also reflect gratefully on all our friends who have supported this open-source project and brought such wonderful contributions of creativity and knowledge to Manifold in the past year.

Thank you for being part of our community, and warmest holiday wishes from all of us.
