This is part 3 of the Travels with Terence series, following our digital projects editor on his pilot press in-person training program.

In honor of University Press Week ([#TurnitUP](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TurnItUp&src=tyah)), we’re spotlighting our most recent Manifold Digital Services Pilot—[Indiana University Press](https://www.iupress.indiana.edu/)! Spearheaded by Michael Regoli, Director of Publishing Operations, the Indiana team dove deep into Manifold this week.

Upon first joining the Manifold Digital Services Pilot Regoli remarked:

> “As technology in scholarly publishing continues to evolve and mature, the digital platforms and tools to support our craft continue pushing the boundaries of innovation. Indiana University Press is excited to join the University of Minnesota Press and its partners in piloting Manifold, to help it meet the changing needs of authors, scholars, and readers. The Manifold platform will provide IUP with a unique content vehicle for born-digital scholarship, allowing content in the platform to remain evergreen, while providing media-rich experiences for readers across the spectrum of devices. We are committed to opening up content to authors and those accessing their work in radically transformative ways. We believe Manifold will help us remain in the vanguard of engineering scholarly content by expanding options for our authors who are both excited to enhance the ways in which their research is shared and their stories are told.”

Beyond having the opportunity to work hand-in-hand with press staff for two days, Michael provided Terence a platform on which to speak to the broader university community, from those in the library, IT, and English departments, as well as other stakeholders and interested parties, about Manifold's origins, capabilities, and development roadmap. In our webcall following his return, Terence noted how important and exciting that was.

> “It was great to be able to engage directly with those on campus who may have heard about the work we're doing but hadn't actually yet seen what Manifold can do, both for the press but also for the campus more generally. It was a wonderful means to secure some fresh perspectives and get a good sense of what's important to those who have been looking for a platform like ours. I think it helps confirm a lot of the decisions we've made as well as highlight some areas we need to consider more fully.”

Luckily, we'll be able to consider these questions with Terence in a few weeks when we gather in Portland for another round of Manifold team meetings.

> Just returned from a fantastic trip to Indiana. Thank you @GaryDunhamIUP, @mr_iupress, and everyone at @iupress! What an amazing team you have; we're honored you're a part of the @ManifoldScholar community and so excited to be working together!
