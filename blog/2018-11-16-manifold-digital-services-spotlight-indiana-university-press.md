In honor of University Press Week ([#TurnitUP](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TurnItUp&src=tyah)), we’re spotlighting our most recent Manifold Digital Services Pilot—[Indiana University Press](https://www.iupress.indiana.edu/)! Spearheaded by Michael Regoli, Director of Publishing Operations, the Indiana team dove deep into Manifold this week.[![](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/11/iu-statue-211x300.jpg)](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/11/iu-statue.jpg) A plaster cast of Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux’s Ugolina and His Sons, (1861) awaits those entering the Indiana Memorial Union. Upon first joining the Manifold Digital Services Pilot Regoli remarked:

> “As technology in scholarly publishing continues to evolve and mature, the digital platforms and tools to support our craft continue pushing the boundaries of innovation. Indiana University Press is excited to join the University of Minnesota Press and its partners in piloting Manifold, to help it meet the changing needs of authors, scholars, and readers. The Manifold platform will provide IUP with a unique content vehicle for born-digital scholarship, allowing content in the platform to remain evergreen, while providing media-rich experiences for readers across the spectrum of devices. We are committed to opening up content to authors and those accessing their work in radically transformative ways. We believe Manifold will help us remain in the vanguard of engineering scholarly content by expanding options for our authors who are both excited to enhance the ways in which their research is shared and their stories are told.”

In our webcall following his return, Terence noted how important and exciting that was.

> “It was great to be able to engage directly with those on campus who may have heard about the work we're doing but hadn't actually yet seen what Manifold can do, both for the press but also for the campus more generally. It was a wonderful means to secure some fresh perspectives and get a good sense of what's important to those who have been looking for a platform like ours. I think it helps confirm a lot of the decisions we've made as well as highlight some areas we need to consider more fully.”

Luckily, we'll be able to consider these questions with Terence in a few weeks when we gather in Portland for another round of Manifold team meetings.&nbsp; https://twitter.com/tremayning/status/1062758396842139648 &nbsp; [![](/img/blog/legacy_wp/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-16-at-2.15.05-PM.png)](https://twitter.com/Mort_iupress/status/1063085465035829248)In addition to a robust journals program, Indiana University Press publishes over 170 new titles each year across an array of imprints.
